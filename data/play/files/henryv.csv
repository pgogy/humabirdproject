1				ACT I	
2				SCENE I. London. The palace.
3				Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others
4	1	1.1.1	KING HENRY IV	So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
5	1	1.1.2	KING HENRY IV	Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
6	1	1.1.3	KING HENRY IV	And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
7	1	1.1.4	KING HENRY IV	To be commenced in strands afar remote.
8	1	1.1.5	KING HENRY IV	No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
9	1	1.1.6	KING HENRY IV	Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
10	1	1.1.7	KING HENRY IV	Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
11	1	1.1.8	KING HENRY IV	Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
12	1	1.1.9	KING HENRY IV	Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
13	1	1.1.10	KING HENRY IV	Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
14	1	1.1.11	KING HENRY IV	All of one nature, of one substance bred,
15	1	1.1.12	KING HENRY IV	Did lately meet in the intestine shock
16	1	1.1.13	KING HENRY IV	And furious close of civil butchery
17	1	1.1.14	KING HENRY IV	Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
18	1	1.1.15	KING HENRY IV	March all one way and be no more opposed
19	1	1.1.16	KING HENRY IV	Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
20	1	1.1.17	KING HENRY IV	The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
21	1	1.1.18	KING HENRY IV	No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
22	1	1.1.19	KING HENRY IV	As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
23	1	1.1.20	KING HENRY IV	Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
24	1	1.1.21	KING HENRY IV	We are impressed and engaged to fight,
25	1	1.1.22	KING HENRY IV	Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
26	1	1.1.23	KING HENRY IV	Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
27	1	1.1.24	KING HENRY IV	To chase these pagans in those holy fields
28	1	1.1.25	KING HENRY IV	Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
29	1	1.1.26	KING HENRY IV	Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
30	1	1.1.27	KING HENRY IV	For our advantage on the bitter cross.
31	1	1.1.28	KING HENRY IV	But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
32	1	1.1.29	KING HENRY IV	And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
33	1	1.1.30	KING HENRY IV	Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
34	1	1.1.31	KING HENRY IV	Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
35	1	1.1.32	KING HENRY IV	What yesternight our council did decree
36	1	1.1.33	KING HENRY IV	In forwarding this dear expedience.
37	2	1.1.34	WESTMORELAND	My liege, this haste was hot in question,
38	2	1.1.35	WESTMORELAND	And many limits of the charge set down
39	2	1.1.36	WESTMORELAND	But yesternight: when all athwart there came
40	2	1.1.37	WESTMORELAND	A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
41	2	1.1.38	WESTMORELAND	Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
42	2	1.1.39	WESTMORELAND	Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
43	2	1.1.40	WESTMORELAND	Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
44	2	1.1.41	WESTMORELAND	Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
45	2	1.1.42	WESTMORELAND	A thousand of his people butchered;
46	2	1.1.43	WESTMORELAND	Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
47	2	1.1.44	WESTMORELAND	Such beastly shameless transformation,
48	2	1.1.45	WESTMORELAND	By those Welshwomen done as may not be
49	2	1.1.46	WESTMORELAND	Without much shame retold or spoken of.
50	3	1.1.47	KING HENRY IV	It seems then that the tidings of this broil
51	3	1.1.48	KING HENRY IV	Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
52	4	1.1.49	WESTMORELAND	This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
53	4	1.1.50	WESTMORELAND	For more uneven and unwelcome news
54	4	1.1.51	WESTMORELAND	Came from the north and thus it did import:
55	4	1.1.52	WESTMORELAND	On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
56	4	1.1.53	WESTMORELAND	Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
57	4	1.1.54	WESTMORELAND	That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
58	4	1.1.55	WESTMORELAND	At Holmedon met,
59	4	1.1.56	WESTMORELAND	Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
60	4	1.1.57	WESTMORELAND	As by discharge of their artillery,
61	4	1.1.58	WESTMORELAND	And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
62	4	1.1.59	WESTMORELAND	For he that brought them, in the very heat
63	4	1.1.60	WESTMORELAND	And pride of their contention did take horse,
64	4	1.1.61	WESTMORELAND	Uncertain of the issue any way.
65	5	1.1.62	KING HENRY IV	Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
66	5	1.1.63	KING HENRY IV	Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
67	5	1.1.64	KING HENRY IV	Stain'd with the variation of each soil
68	5	1.1.65	KING HENRY IV	Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
69	5	1.1.66	KING HENRY IV	And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
70	5	1.1.67	KING HENRY IV	The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
71	5	1.1.68	KING HENRY IV	Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
72	5	1.1.69	KING HENRY IV	Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
73	5	1.1.70	KING HENRY IV	On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
74	5	1.1.71	KING HENRY IV	Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
75	5	1.1.72	KING HENRY IV	To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
76	5	1.1.73	KING HENRY IV	Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
77	5	1.1.74	KING HENRY IV	And is not this an honourable spoil?
78	5	1.1.75	KING HENRY IV	A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
79	6	1.1.76	WESTMORELAND	In faith,
80	6	1.1.77	WESTMORELAND	It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
81	7	1.1.78	KING HENRY IV	Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
82	7	1.1.79	KING HENRY IV	In envy that my Lord Northumberland
83	7	1.1.80	KING HENRY IV	Should be the father to so blest a son,
84	7	1.1.81	KING HENRY IV	A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
85	7	1.1.82	KING HENRY IV	Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
86	7	1.1.83	KING HENRY IV	Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
87	7	1.1.84	KING HENRY IV	Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
88	7	1.1.85	KING HENRY IV	See riot and dishonour stain the brow
89	7	1.1.86	KING HENRY IV	Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
90	7	1.1.87	KING HENRY IV	That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
91	7	1.1.88	KING HENRY IV	In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
92	7	1.1.89	KING HENRY IV	And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
93	7	1.1.90	KING HENRY IV	Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
94	7	1.1.91	KING HENRY IV	But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
95	7	1.1.92	KING HENRY IV	Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
96	7	1.1.93	KING HENRY IV	Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
97	7	1.1.94	KING HENRY IV	To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
98	7	1.1.95	KING HENRY IV	I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
99	8	1.1.96	WESTMORELAND	This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
100	8	1.1.97	WESTMORELAND	Malevolent to you in all aspects;
101	8	1.1.98	WESTMORELAND	Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
102	8	1.1.99	WESTMORELAND	The crest of youth against your dignity.
103	9	1.1.100	KING HENRY IV	But I have sent for him to answer this;
104	9	1.1.101	KING HENRY IV	And for this cause awhile we must neglect
105	9	1.1.102	KING HENRY IV	Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
106	9	1.1.103	KING HENRY IV	Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
107	9	1.1.104	KING HENRY IV	Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
108	9	1.1.105	KING HENRY IV	But come yourself with speed to us again;
109	9	1.1.106	KING HENRY IV	For more is to be said and to be done
110	9	1.1.107	KING HENRY IV	Than out of anger can be uttered.
111	10	1.1.108	WESTMORELAND	I will, my liege.
112	10		WESTMORELAND	Exeunt
113	10		WESTMORELAND	SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
114	10		WESTMORELAND	Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
115	1	1.2.1	FALSTAFF	Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
116	2	1.2.2	PRINCE HENRY	Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
117	2	1.2.3	PRINCE HENRY	and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
118	2	1.2.4	PRINCE HENRY	benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
119	2	1.2.5	PRINCE HENRY	demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
120	2	1.2.6	PRINCE HENRY	What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
121	2	1.2.7	PRINCE HENRY	day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
122	2	1.2.8	PRINCE HENRY	capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
123	2	1.2.9	PRINCE HENRY	signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
124	2	1.2.10	PRINCE HENRY	a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
125	2	1.2.11	PRINCE HENRY	reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
126	2	1.2.12	PRINCE HENRY	the time of the day.
127	3	1.2.13	FALSTAFF	Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
128	3	1.2.14	FALSTAFF	purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
129	3	1.2.15	FALSTAFF	by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
130	3	1.2.16	FALSTAFF	I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
131	3	1.2.17	FALSTAFF	save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
132	3	1.2.18	FALSTAFF	thou wilt have none,--
133	4	1.2.19	PRINCE HENRY	What, none?
134	5	1.2.20	FALSTAFF	No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
135	5	1.2.21	FALSTAFF	prologue to an egg and butter.
136	6	1.2.22	PRINCE HENRY	Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
137	7	1.2.23	FALSTAFF	Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
138	7	1.2.24	FALSTAFF	us that are squires of the night's body be called
139	7	1.2.25	FALSTAFF	thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
140	7	1.2.26	FALSTAFF	foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
141	7	1.2.27	FALSTAFF	moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
142	7	1.2.28	FALSTAFF	being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
143	7	1.2.29	FALSTAFF	chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
144	8	1.2.30	PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
145	8	1.2.31	PRINCE HENRY	fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
146	8	1.2.32	PRINCE HENRY	flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
147	8	1.2.33	PRINCE HENRY	by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
148	8	1.2.34	PRINCE HENRY	most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
149	8	1.2.35	PRINCE HENRY	dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
150	8	1.2.36	PRINCE HENRY	swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
151	8	1.2.37	PRINCE HENRY	now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
152	8	1.2.38	PRINCE HENRY	and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
153	9	1.2.39	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
154	9	1.2.40	FALSTAFF	hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
155	10	1.2.41	PRINCE HENRY	As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
156	10	1.2.42	PRINCE HENRY	is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
157	11	1.2.43	FALSTAFF	How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
158	11	1.2.44	FALSTAFF	thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
159	11	1.2.45	FALSTAFF	buff jerkin?
160	12	1.2.46	PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
161	13	1.2.47	FALSTAFF	Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
162	13	1.2.48	FALSTAFF	time and oft.
163	14	1.2.49	PRINCE HENRY	Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
164	15	1.2.50	FALSTAFF	No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
165	16	1.2.51	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
166	16	1.2.52	PRINCE HENRY	and where it would not, I have used my credit.
167	17	1.2.53	FALSTAFF	Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
168	17	1.2.54	FALSTAFF	that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
169	17	1.2.55	FALSTAFF	wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
170	17	1.2.56	FALSTAFF	thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
171	17	1.2.57	FALSTAFF	with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
172	17	1.2.58	FALSTAFF	not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
173	18	1.2.59	PRINCE HENRY	No; thou shalt.
174	19	1.2.60	FALSTAFF	Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
175	20	1.2.61	PRINCE HENRY	Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
176	20	1.2.62	PRINCE HENRY	the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
177	21	1.2.63	FALSTAFF	Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
178	21	1.2.64	FALSTAFF	humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
179	21	1.2.65	FALSTAFF	you.
180	22	1.2.66	PRINCE HENRY	For obtaining of suits?
181	23	1.2.67	FALSTAFF	Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
182	23	1.2.68	FALSTAFF	hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
183	23	1.2.69	FALSTAFF	as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
184	24	1.2.70	PRINCE HENRY	Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
185	25	1.2.71	FALSTAFF	Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
186	26	1.2.72	PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
187	26	1.2.73	PRINCE HENRY	Moor-ditch?
188	27	1.2.74	FALSTAFF	Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
189	27	1.2.75	FALSTAFF	the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
190	27	1.2.76	FALSTAFF	prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
191	27	1.2.77	FALSTAFF	with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
192	27	1.2.78	FALSTAFF	commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
193	27	1.2.79	FALSTAFF	lord of the council rated me the other day in the
194	27	1.2.80	FALSTAFF	street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
195	27	1.2.81	FALSTAFF	he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
196	27	1.2.82	FALSTAFF	yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
197	28	1.2.83	PRINCE HENRY	Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
198	28	1.2.84	PRINCE HENRY	streets, and no man regards it.
199	29	1.2.85	FALSTAFF	O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
200	29	1.2.86	FALSTAFF	to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
201	29	1.2.87	FALSTAFF	me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
202	29	1.2.88	FALSTAFF	thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
203	29	1.2.89	FALSTAFF	should speak truly, little better than one of the
204	29	1.2.90	FALSTAFF	wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
205	29	1.2.91	FALSTAFF	it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
206	29	1.2.92	FALSTAFF	I'll be damned for never a king's son in
207	29	1.2.93	FALSTAFF	Christendom.
208	30	1.2.94	PRINCE HENRY	Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
209	31	1.2.95	FALSTAFF	'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
210	31	1.2.96	FALSTAFF	do not, call me villain and baffle me.
211	32	1.2.97	PRINCE HENRY	I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
212	32	1.2.98	PRINCE HENRY	to purse-taking.
213	33	1.2.99	FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
214	33	1.2.100	FALSTAFF	man to labour in his vocation.
215	33		FALSTAFF	Enter POINS
216	33	1.2.101	FALSTAFF	Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
217	33	1.2.102	FALSTAFF	match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
218	33	1.2.103	FALSTAFF	hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
219	33	1.2.104	FALSTAFF	most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
220	33	1.2.105	FALSTAFF	a true man.
221	34	1.2.106	PRINCE HENRY	Good morrow, Ned.
222	35	1.2.107	POINS	Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
223	35	1.2.108	POINS	what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
224	35	1.2.109	POINS	agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
225	35	1.2.110	POINS	soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
226	35	1.2.111	POINS	and a cold capon's leg?
227	36	1.2.112	PRINCE HENRY	Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
228	36	1.2.113	PRINCE HENRY	his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
229	36	1.2.114	PRINCE HENRY	proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
230	37	1.2.115	POINS	Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
231	38	1.2.116	PRINCE HENRY	Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
232	39	1.2.117	POINS	But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
233	39	1.2.118	POINS	o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
234	39	1.2.119	POINS	to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
235	39	1.2.120	POINS	riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
236	39	1.2.121	POINS	for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
237	39	1.2.122	POINS	Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
238	39	1.2.123	POINS	supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
239	39	1.2.124	POINS	as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
240	39	1.2.125	POINS	your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
241	39	1.2.126	POINS	at home and be hanged.
242	40	1.2.127	FALSTAFF	Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
243	40	1.2.128	FALSTAFF	I'll hang you for going.
244	41	1.2.129	POINS	You will, chops?
245	42	1.2.130	FALSTAFF	Hal, wilt thou make one?
246	43	1.2.131	PRINCE HENRY	Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
247	44	1.2.132	FALSTAFF	There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
248	44	1.2.133	FALSTAFF	fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
249	44	1.2.134	FALSTAFF	royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
250	45	1.2.135	PRINCE HENRY	Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
251	46	1.2.136	FALSTAFF	Why, that's well said.
252	47	1.2.137	PRINCE HENRY	Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
253	48	1.2.138	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
254	49	1.2.139	PRINCE HENRY	I care not.
255	50	1.2.140	POINS	Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
256	50	1.2.141	POINS	I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
257	50	1.2.142	POINS	that he shall go.
258	51	1.2.143	FALSTAFF	Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
259	51	1.2.144	FALSTAFF	the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
260	51	1.2.145	FALSTAFF	move and what he hears may be believed, that the
261	51	1.2.146	FALSTAFF	true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
262	51	1.2.147	FALSTAFF	thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
263	51	1.2.148	FALSTAFF	countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
264	52	1.2.149	PRINCE HENRY	Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
265	52		PRINCE HENRY	Exit Falstaff
266	53	1.2.150	POINS	Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
267	53	1.2.151	POINS	to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
268	53	1.2.152	POINS	manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
269	53	1.2.153	POINS	shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
270	53	1.2.154	POINS	yourself and I will not be there; and when they
271	53	1.2.155	POINS	have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
272	53	1.2.156	POINS	this head off from my shoulders.
273	54	1.2.157	PRINCE HENRY	How shall we part with them in setting forth?
274	55	1.2.158	POINS	Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
275	55	1.2.159	POINS	appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
276	55	1.2.160	POINS	our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
277	55	1.2.161	POINS	upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
278	55	1.2.162	POINS	no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
279	56	1.2.163	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
280	56	1.2.164	PRINCE HENRY	horses, by our habits and by every other
281	56	1.2.165	PRINCE HENRY	appointment, to be ourselves.
282	57	1.2.166	POINS	Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
283	57	1.2.167	POINS	in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
284	57	1.2.168	POINS	leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
285	57	1.2.169	POINS	for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
286	58	1.2.170	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
287	59	1.2.171	POINS	Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
288	59	1.2.172	POINS	true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
289	59	1.2.173	POINS	third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
290	59	1.2.174	POINS	forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
291	59	1.2.175	POINS	incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
292	59	1.2.176	POINS	tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
293	59	1.2.177	POINS	least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
294	59	1.2.178	POINS	extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
295	59	1.2.179	POINS	lies the jest.
296	60	1.2.180	PRINCE HENRY	Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
297	60	1.2.181	PRINCE HENRY	necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
298	60	1.2.182	PRINCE HENRY	there I'll sup. Farewell.
299	61	1.2.183	POINS	Farewell, my lord.
300	61		POINS	Exit Poins
301	62	1.2.184	PRINCE HENRY	I know you all, and will awhile uphold
302	62	1.2.185	PRINCE HENRY	The unyoked humour of your idleness:
303	62	1.2.186	PRINCE HENRY	Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
304	62	1.2.187	PRINCE HENRY	Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
305	62	1.2.188	PRINCE HENRY	To smother up his beauty from the world,
306	62	1.2.189	PRINCE HENRY	That, when he please again to be himself,
307	62	1.2.190	PRINCE HENRY	Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
308	62	1.2.191	PRINCE HENRY	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
309	62	1.2.192	PRINCE HENRY	Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
310	62	1.2.193	PRINCE HENRY	If all the year were playing holidays,
311	62	1.2.194	PRINCE HENRY	To sport would be as tedious as to work;
312	62	1.2.195	PRINCE HENRY	But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
313	62	1.2.196	PRINCE HENRY	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
314	62	1.2.197	PRINCE HENRY	So, when this loose behavior I throw off
315	62	1.2.198	PRINCE HENRY	And pay the debt I never promised,
316	62	1.2.199	PRINCE HENRY	By how much better than my word I am,
317	62	1.2.200	PRINCE HENRY	By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
318	62	1.2.201	PRINCE HENRY	And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
319	62	1.2.202	PRINCE HENRY	My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
320	62	1.2.203	PRINCE HENRY	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
321	62	1.2.204	PRINCE HENRY	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
322	62	1.2.205	PRINCE HENRY	I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
323	62	1.2.206	PRINCE HENRY	Redeeming time when men think least I will.
324	62		PRINCE HENRY	Exit
325	62		PRINCE HENRY	SCENE III. London. The palace.
326	62		PRINCE HENRY	Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others
327	1	1.3.1	KING HENRY IV	My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
328	1	1.3.2	KING HENRY IV	Unapt to stir at these indignities,
329	1	1.3.3	KING HENRY IV	And you have found me; for accordingly
330	1	1.3.4	KING HENRY IV	You tread upon my patience: but be sure
331	1	1.3.5	KING HENRY IV	I will from henceforth rather be myself,
332	1	1.3.6	KING HENRY IV	Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
333	1	1.3.7	KING HENRY IV	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
334	1	1.3.8	KING HENRY IV	And therefore lost that title of respect
335	1	1.3.9	KING HENRY IV	Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
336	2	1.3.10	EARL OF WORCESTER	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
337	2	1.3.11	EARL OF WORCESTER	The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
338	2	1.3.12	EARL OF WORCESTER	And that same greatness too which our own hands
339	2	1.3.13	EARL OF WORCESTER	Have holp to make so portly.
340	3	1.3.14	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord.--
341	4	1.3.15	KING HENRY IV	Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
342	4	1.3.16	KING HENRY IV	Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
343	4	1.3.17	KING HENRY IV	O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
344	4	1.3.18	KING HENRY IV	And majesty might never yet endure
345	4	1.3.19	KING HENRY IV	The moody frontier of a servant brow.
346	4	1.3.20	KING HENRY IV	You have good leave to leave us: when we need
347	4	1.3.21	KING HENRY IV	Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
348	4		KING HENRY IV	Exit Worcester
349	4	1.3.22	KING HENRY IV	You were about to speak.
350	4		KING HENRY IV	To North
351	5	1.3.23	NORTHUMBERLAND	Yea, my good lord.
352	5	1.3.24	NORTHUMBERLAND	Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
353	5	1.3.25	NORTHUMBERLAND	Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
354	5	1.3.26	NORTHUMBERLAND	Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
355	5	1.3.27	NORTHUMBERLAND	As is deliver'd to your majesty:
356	5	1.3.28	NORTHUMBERLAND	Either envy, therefore, or misprison
357	5	1.3.29	NORTHUMBERLAND	Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
358	6	1.3.30	HOTSPUR	My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
359	6	1.3.31	HOTSPUR	But I remember, when the fight was done,
360	6	1.3.32	HOTSPUR	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
361	6	1.3.33	HOTSPUR	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
362	6	1.3.34	HOTSPUR	Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
363	6	1.3.35	HOTSPUR	Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
364	6	1.3.36	HOTSPUR	Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
365	6	1.3.37	HOTSPUR	He was perfumed like a milliner;
366	6	1.3.38	HOTSPUR	And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
367	6	1.3.39	HOTSPUR	A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
368	6	1.3.40	HOTSPUR	He gave his nose and took't away again;
369	6	1.3.41	HOTSPUR	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
370	6	1.3.42	HOTSPUR	Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
371	6	1.3.43	HOTSPUR	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
372	6	1.3.44	HOTSPUR	He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
373	6	1.3.45	HOTSPUR	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
374	6	1.3.46	HOTSPUR	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
375	6	1.3.47	HOTSPUR	With many holiday and lady terms
376	6	1.3.48	HOTSPUR	He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
377	6	1.3.49	HOTSPUR	My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
378	6	1.3.50	HOTSPUR	I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
379	6	1.3.51	HOTSPUR	To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
380	6	1.3.52	HOTSPUR	Out of my grief and my impatience,
381	6	1.3.53	HOTSPUR	Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
382	6	1.3.54	HOTSPUR	He should or he should not; for he made me mad
383	6	1.3.55	HOTSPUR	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
384	6	1.3.56	HOTSPUR	And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
385	6	1.3.57	HOTSPUR	Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
386	6	1.3.58	HOTSPUR	And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
387	6	1.3.59	HOTSPUR	Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
388	6	1.3.60	HOTSPUR	And that it was great pity, so it was,
389	6	1.3.61	HOTSPUR	This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
390	6	1.3.62	HOTSPUR	Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
391	6	1.3.63	HOTSPUR	Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
392	6	1.3.64	HOTSPUR	So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
393	6	1.3.65	HOTSPUR	He would himself have been a soldier.
394	6	1.3.66	HOTSPUR	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
395	6	1.3.67	HOTSPUR	I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
396	6	1.3.68	HOTSPUR	And I beseech you, let not his report
397	6	1.3.69	HOTSPUR	Come current for an accusation
398	6	1.3.70	HOTSPUR	Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
399	7	1.3.71	SIR WALTER BLUNT	The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
400	7	1.3.72	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
401	7	1.3.73	SIR WALTER BLUNT	To such a person and in such a place,
402	7	1.3.74	SIR WALTER BLUNT	At such a time, with all the rest retold,
403	7	1.3.75	SIR WALTER BLUNT	May reasonably die and never rise
404	7	1.3.76	SIR WALTER BLUNT	To do him wrong or any way impeach
405	7	1.3.77	SIR WALTER BLUNT	What then he said, so he unsay it now.
406	8	1.3.78	KING HENRY IV	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
407	8	1.3.79	KING HENRY IV	But with proviso and exception,
408	8	1.3.80	KING HENRY IV	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
409	8	1.3.81	KING HENRY IV	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
410	8	1.3.82	KING HENRY IV	Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
411	8	1.3.83	KING HENRY IV	The lives of those that he did lead to fight
412	8	1.3.84	KING HENRY IV	Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
413	8	1.3.85	KING HENRY IV	Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
414	8	1.3.86	KING HENRY IV	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
415	8	1.3.87	KING HENRY IV	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
416	8	1.3.88	KING HENRY IV	Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
417	8	1.3.89	KING HENRY IV	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
418	8	1.3.90	KING HENRY IV	No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
419	8	1.3.91	KING HENRY IV	For I shall never hold that man my friend
420	8	1.3.92	KING HENRY IV	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
421	8	1.3.93	KING HENRY IV	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
422	9	1.3.94	HOTSPUR	Revolted Mortimer!
423	9	1.3.95	HOTSPUR	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
424	9	1.3.96	HOTSPUR	But by the chance of war; to prove that true
425	9	1.3.97	HOTSPUR	Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
426	9	1.3.98	HOTSPUR	Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
427	9	1.3.99	HOTSPUR	When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
428	9	1.3.100	HOTSPUR	In single opposition, hand to hand,
429	9	1.3.101	HOTSPUR	He did confound the best part of an hour
430	9	1.3.102	HOTSPUR	In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
431	9	1.3.103	HOTSPUR	Three times they breathed and three times did
432	9	1.3.104	HOTSPUR	they drink,
433	9	1.3.105	HOTSPUR	Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
434	9	1.3.106	HOTSPUR	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
435	9	1.3.107	HOTSPUR	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
436	9	1.3.108	HOTSPUR	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
437	9	1.3.109	HOTSPUR	Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
438	9	1.3.110	HOTSPUR	Never did base and rotten policy
439	9	1.3.111	HOTSPUR	Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
440	9	1.3.112	HOTSPUR	Nor could the noble Mortimer
441	9	1.3.113	HOTSPUR	Receive so many, and all willingly:
442	9	1.3.114	HOTSPUR	Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
443	10	1.3.115	KING HENRY IV	Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
444	10	1.3.116	KING HENRY IV	He never did encounter with Glendower:
445	10	1.3.117	KING HENRY IV	I tell thee,
446	10	1.3.118	KING HENRY IV	He durst as well have met the devil alone
447	10	1.3.119	KING HENRY IV	As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
448	10	1.3.120	KING HENRY IV	Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
449	10	1.3.121	KING HENRY IV	Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
450	10	1.3.122	KING HENRY IV	Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
451	10	1.3.123	KING HENRY IV	Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
452	10	1.3.124	KING HENRY IV	As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
453	10	1.3.125	KING HENRY IV	We licence your departure with your son.
454	10	1.3.126	KING HENRY IV	Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
455	10		KING HENRY IV	Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train
456	11	1.3.127	HOTSPUR	An if the devil come and roar for them,
457	11	1.3.128	HOTSPUR	I will not send them: I will after straight
458	11	1.3.129	HOTSPUR	And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
459	11	1.3.130	HOTSPUR	Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
460	12	1.3.131	NORTHUMBERLAND	What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
461	12	1.3.132	NORTHUMBERLAND	Here comes your uncle.
462	12		NORTHUMBERLAND	Re-enter WORCESTER
463	13	1.3.133	HOTSPUR	Speak of Mortimer!
464	13	1.3.134	HOTSPUR	'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
465	13	1.3.135	HOTSPUR	Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
466	13	1.3.136	HOTSPUR	Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
467	13	1.3.137	HOTSPUR	And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
468	13	1.3.138	HOTSPUR	But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
469	13	1.3.139	HOTSPUR	As high in the air as this unthankful king,
470	13	1.3.140	HOTSPUR	As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
471	14	1.3.141	NORTHUMBERLAND	Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
472	15	1.3.142	EARL OF WORCESTER	Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
473	16	1.3.143	HOTSPUR	He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
474	16	1.3.144	HOTSPUR	And when I urged the ransom once again
475	16	1.3.145	HOTSPUR	Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
476	16	1.3.146	HOTSPUR	And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
477	16	1.3.147	HOTSPUR	Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
478	17	1.3.148	EARL OF WORCESTER	I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
479	17	1.3.149	EARL OF WORCESTER	By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
480	18	1.3.150	NORTHUMBERLAND	He was; I heard the proclamation:
481	18	1.3.151	NORTHUMBERLAND	And then it was when the unhappy king,
482	18	1.3.152	NORTHUMBERLAND	--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
483	18	1.3.153	NORTHUMBERLAND	Upon his Irish expedition;
484	18	1.3.154	NORTHUMBERLAND	From whence he intercepted did return
485	18	1.3.155	NORTHUMBERLAND	To be deposed and shortly murdered.
486	19	1.3.156	EARL OF WORCESTER	And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
487	19	1.3.157	EARL OF WORCESTER	Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
488	20	1.3.158	HOTSPUR	But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
489	20	1.3.159	HOTSPUR	Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
490	20	1.3.160	HOTSPUR	Heir to the crown?
491	21	1.3.161	NORTHUMBERLAND	He did; myself did hear it.
492	22	1.3.162	HOTSPUR	Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
493	22	1.3.163	HOTSPUR	That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
494	22	1.3.164	HOTSPUR	But shall it be that you, that set the crown
495	22	1.3.165	HOTSPUR	Upon the head of this forgetful man
496	22	1.3.166	HOTSPUR	And for his sake wear the detested blot
497	22	1.3.167	HOTSPUR	Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
498	22	1.3.168	HOTSPUR	That you a world of curses undergo,
499	22	1.3.169	HOTSPUR	Being the agents, or base second means,
500	22	1.3.170	HOTSPUR	The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
501	22	1.3.171	HOTSPUR	O, pardon me that I descend so low,
502	22	1.3.172	HOTSPUR	To show the line and the predicament
503	22	1.3.173	HOTSPUR	Wherein you range under this subtle king;
504	22	1.3.174	HOTSPUR	Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
505	22	1.3.175	HOTSPUR	Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
506	22	1.3.176	HOTSPUR	That men of your nobility and power
507	22	1.3.177	HOTSPUR	Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
508	22	1.3.178	HOTSPUR	As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
509	22	1.3.179	HOTSPUR	To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
510	22	1.3.180	HOTSPUR	An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
511	22	1.3.181	HOTSPUR	And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
512	22	1.3.182	HOTSPUR	That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
513	22	1.3.183	HOTSPUR	By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
514	22	1.3.184	HOTSPUR	No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
515	22	1.3.185	HOTSPUR	Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
516	22	1.3.186	HOTSPUR	Into the good thoughts of the world again,
517	22	1.3.187	HOTSPUR	Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
518	22	1.3.188	HOTSPUR	Of this proud king, who studies day and night
519	22	1.3.189	HOTSPUR	To answer all the debt he owes to you
520	22	1.3.190	HOTSPUR	Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
521	22	1.3.191	HOTSPUR	Therefore, I say--
522	23	1.3.192	EARL OF WORCESTER	Peace, cousin, say no more:
523	23	1.3.193	EARL OF WORCESTER	And now I will unclasp a secret book,
524	23	1.3.194	EARL OF WORCESTER	And to your quick-conceiving discontents
525	23	1.3.195	EARL OF WORCESTER	I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
526	23	1.3.196	EARL OF WORCESTER	As full of peril and adventurous spirit
527	23	1.3.197	EARL OF WORCESTER	As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
528	23	1.3.198	EARL OF WORCESTER	On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
529	24	1.3.199	HOTSPUR	If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
530	24	1.3.200	HOTSPUR	Send danger from the east unto the west,
531	24	1.3.201	HOTSPUR	So honour cross it from the north to south,
532	24	1.3.202	HOTSPUR	And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
533	24	1.3.203	HOTSPUR	To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
534	25	1.3.204	NORTHUMBERLAND	Imagination of some great exploit
535	25	1.3.205	NORTHUMBERLAND	Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
536	26	1.3.206	HOTSPUR	By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
537	26	1.3.207	HOTSPUR	To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
538	26	1.3.208	HOTSPUR	Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
539	26	1.3.209	HOTSPUR	Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
540	26	1.3.210	HOTSPUR	And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
541	26	1.3.211	HOTSPUR	So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
542	26	1.3.212	HOTSPUR	Without corrival, all her dignities:
543	26	1.3.213	HOTSPUR	But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
544	27	1.3.214	EARL OF WORCESTER	He apprehends a world of figures here,
545	27	1.3.215	EARL OF WORCESTER	But not the form of what he should attend.
546	27	1.3.216	EARL OF WORCESTER	Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
547	28	1.3.217	HOTSPUR	I cry you mercy.
548	29	1.3.218	EARL OF WORCESTER	Those same noble Scots
549	29	1.3.219	EARL OF WORCESTER	That are your prisoners,--
550	30	1.3.220	HOTSPUR	I'll keep them all;
551	30	1.3.221	HOTSPUR	By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
552	30	1.3.222	HOTSPUR	No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
553	30	1.3.223	HOTSPUR	I'll keep them, by this hand.
554	31	1.3.224	EARL OF WORCESTER	You start away
555	31	1.3.225	EARL OF WORCESTER	And lend no ear unto my purposes.
556	31	1.3.226	EARL OF WORCESTER	Those prisoners you shall keep.
557	32	1.3.227	HOTSPUR	Nay, I will; that's flat:
558	32	1.3.228	HOTSPUR	He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
559	32	1.3.229	HOTSPUR	Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
560	32	1.3.230	HOTSPUR	But I will find him when he lies asleep,
561	32	1.3.231	HOTSPUR	And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
562	32	1.3.232	HOTSPUR	Nay,
563	32	1.3.233	HOTSPUR	I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
564	32	1.3.234	HOTSPUR	Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
565	32	1.3.235	HOTSPUR	To keep his anger still in motion.
566	33	1.3.236	EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear you, cousin; a word.
567	34	1.3.237	HOTSPUR	All studies here I solemnly defy,
568	34	1.3.238	HOTSPUR	Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
569	34	1.3.239	HOTSPUR	And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
570	34	1.3.240	HOTSPUR	But that I think his father loves him not
571	34	1.3.241	HOTSPUR	And would be glad he met with some mischance,
572	34	1.3.242	HOTSPUR	I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
573	35	1.3.243	EARL OF WORCESTER	Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
574	35	1.3.244	EARL OF WORCESTER	When you are better temper'd to attend.
575	36	1.3.245	NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
576	36	1.3.246	NORTHUMBERLAND	Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
577	36	1.3.247	NORTHUMBERLAND	Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
578	37	1.3.248	HOTSPUR	Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
579	37	1.3.249	HOTSPUR	Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
580	37	1.3.250	HOTSPUR	Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
581	37	1.3.251	HOTSPUR	In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
582	37	1.3.252	HOTSPUR	A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
583	37	1.3.253	HOTSPUR	'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
584	37	1.3.254	HOTSPUR	His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
585	37	1.3.255	HOTSPUR	Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
586	37	1.3.256	HOTSPUR	'Sblood!--
587	37	1.3.257	HOTSPUR	When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
588	38	1.3.258	NORTHUMBERLAND	At Berkley castle.
589	39	1.3.259	HOTSPUR	You say true:
590	39	1.3.260	HOTSPUR	Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
591	39	1.3.261	HOTSPUR	This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
592	39	1.3.262	HOTSPUR	Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
593	39	1.3.263	HOTSPUR	And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
594	39	1.3.264	HOTSPUR	O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
595	39	1.3.265	HOTSPUR	Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.
596	40	1.3.266	EARL OF WORCESTER	Nay, if you have not, to it again;
597	40	1.3.267	EARL OF WORCESTER	We will stay your leisure.
598	41	1.3.268	HOTSPUR	I have done, i' faith.
599	42	1.3.269	EARL OF WORCESTER	Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
600	42	1.3.270	EARL OF WORCESTER	Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
601	42	1.3.271	EARL OF WORCESTER	And make the Douglas' son your only mean
602	42	1.3.272	EARL OF WORCESTER	For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
603	42	1.3.273	EARL OF WORCESTER	Which I shall send you written, be assured,
604	42	1.3.274	EARL OF WORCESTER	Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
605	42		EARL OF WORCESTER	To Northumberland
606	42	1.3.275	EARL OF WORCESTER	Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
607	42	1.3.276	EARL OF WORCESTER	Shall secretly into the bosom creep
608	42	1.3.277	EARL OF WORCESTER	Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
609	42	1.3.278	EARL OF WORCESTER	The archbishop.
610	43	1.3.279	HOTSPUR	Of York, is it not?
611	44	1.3.280	EARL OF WORCESTER	True; who bears hard
612	44	1.3.281	EARL OF WORCESTER	His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
613	44	1.3.282	EARL OF WORCESTER	I speak not this in estimation,
614	44	1.3.283	EARL OF WORCESTER	As what I think might be, but what I know
615	44	1.3.284	EARL OF WORCESTER	Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
616	44	1.3.285	EARL OF WORCESTER	And only stays but to behold the face
617	44	1.3.286	EARL OF WORCESTER	Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
618	45	1.3.287	HOTSPUR	I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
619	46	1.3.288	NORTHUMBERLAND	Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.
620	47	1.3.289	HOTSPUR	Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
621	47	1.3.290	HOTSPUR	And then the power of Scotland and of York,
622	47	1.3.291	HOTSPUR	To join with Mortimer, ha?
623	48	1.3.292	EARL OF WORCESTER	And so they shall.
624	49	1.3.293	HOTSPUR	In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
625	50	1.3.294	EARL OF WORCESTER	And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
626	50	1.3.295	EARL OF WORCESTER	To save our heads by raising of a head;
627	50	1.3.296	EARL OF WORCESTER	For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
628	50	1.3.297	EARL OF WORCESTER	The king will always think him in our debt,
629	50	1.3.298	EARL OF WORCESTER	And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
630	50	1.3.299	EARL OF WORCESTER	Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
631	50	1.3.300	EARL OF WORCESTER	And see already how he doth begin
632	50	1.3.301	EARL OF WORCESTER	To make us strangers to his looks of love.
633	51	1.3.302	HOTSPUR	He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
634	52	1.3.303	EARL OF WORCESTER	Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
635	52	1.3.304	EARL OF WORCESTER	Than I by letters shall direct your course.
636	52	1.3.305	EARL OF WORCESTER	When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
637	52	1.3.306	EARL OF WORCESTER	I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
638	52	1.3.307	EARL OF WORCESTER	Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
639	52	1.3.308	EARL OF WORCESTER	As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
640	52	1.3.309	EARL OF WORCESTER	To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
641	52	1.3.310	EARL OF WORCESTER	Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
642	53	1.3.311	NORTHUMBERLAND	Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
643	54	1.3.312	HOTSPUR	Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
644	54	1.3.313	HOTSPUR	Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!
645	54		HOTSPUR	Exeunt
646	54		HOTSPUR	ACT II
647	54		HOTSPUR	SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard.
648	54		HOTSPUR	Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand
649	1	2.1.1	First Carrier	Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
650	1	2.1.2	First Carrier	hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
651	1	2.1.3	First Carrier	yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!
652	2	2.1.4	Ostler	[Within]   Anon, anon.
653	3	2.1.5	First Carrier	I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
654	3	2.1.6	First Carrier	in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
655	3	2.1.7	First Carrier	of all cess.
656	3		First Carrier	Enter another Carrier
657	4	2.1.8	Second Carrier	Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
658	4	2.1.9	Second Carrier	is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
659	4	2.1.10	Second Carrier	house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
660	5	2.1.11	First Carrier	Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
661	5	2.1.12	First Carrier	rose; it was the death of him.
662	6	2.1.13	Second Carrier	I think this be the most villanous house in all
663	6	2.1.14	Second Carrier	London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
664	7	2.1.15	First Carrier	Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
665	7	2.1.16	First Carrier	christen could be better bit than I have been since
666	7	2.1.17	First Carrier	the first cock.
667	8	2.1.18	Second Carrier	Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
668	8	2.1.19	Second Carrier	leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
669	8	2.1.20	Second Carrier	fleas like a loach.
670	9	2.1.21	First Carrier	What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
671	10	2.1.22	Second Carrier	I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
672	10	2.1.23	Second Carrier	to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
673	11	2.1.24	First Carrier	God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
674	11	2.1.25	First Carrier	starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
675	11	2.1.26	First Carrier	never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
676	11	2.1.27	First Carrier	'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
677	11	2.1.28	First Carrier	on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
678	11	2.1.29	First Carrier	hast thou no faith in thee?
679	11		First Carrier	Enter GADSHILL
680	12	2.1.30	GADSHILL	Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
681	13	2.1.31	First Carrier	I think it be two o'clock.
682	14	2.1.32	GADSHILL	I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
683	14	2.1.33	GADSHILL	in the stable.
684	15	2.1.34	First Carrier	Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
685	16	2.1.35	GADSHILL	I pray thee, lend me thine.
686	17	2.1.36	Second Carrier	Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
687	17	2.1.37	Second Carrier	he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.
688	18	2.1.38	GADSHILL	Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
689	19	2.1.39	Second Carrier	Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
690	19	2.1.40	Second Carrier	thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
691	19	2.1.41	Second Carrier	gentleman: they will along with company, for they
692	19	2.1.42	Second Carrier	have great charge.
693	19		Second Carrier	Exeunt carriers
694	20	2.1.43	GADSHILL	What, ho! chamberlain!
695	21	2.1.44	Chamberlain	[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse.
696	22	2.1.45	GADSHILL	That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
697	22	2.1.46	GADSHILL	chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
698	22	2.1.47	GADSHILL	of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
699	22	2.1.48	GADSHILL	thou layest the plot how.
700	22		GADSHILL	Enter Chamberlain
701	23	2.1.49	Chamberlain	Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
702	23	2.1.50	Chamberlain	I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
703	23	2.1.51	Chamberlain	wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
704	23	2.1.52	Chamberlain	him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
705	23	2.1.53	Chamberlain	company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
706	23	2.1.54	Chamberlain	that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
707	23	2.1.55	Chamberlain	They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
708	23	2.1.56	Chamberlain	they will away presently.
709	24	2.1.57	GADSHILL	Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
710	24	2.1.58	GADSHILL	clerks, I'll give thee this neck.
711	25	2.1.59	Chamberlain	No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
712	25	2.1.60	Chamberlain	hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
713	25	2.1.61	Chamberlain	as truly as a man of falsehood may.
714	26	2.1.62	GADSHILL	What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
715	26	2.1.63	GADSHILL	I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
716	26	2.1.64	GADSHILL	Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
717	26	2.1.65	GADSHILL	starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
718	26	2.1.66	GADSHILL	dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
719	26	2.1.67	GADSHILL	content to do the profession some grace; that would,
720	26	2.1.68	GADSHILL	if matters should be looked into, for their own
721	26	2.1.69	GADSHILL	credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
722	26	2.1.70	GADSHILL	foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
723	26	2.1.71	GADSHILL	none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
724	26	2.1.72	GADSHILL	but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
725	26	2.1.73	GADSHILL	great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
726	26	2.1.74	GADSHILL	strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
727	26	2.1.75	GADSHILL	drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
728	26	2.1.76	GADSHILL	I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
729	26	2.1.77	GADSHILL	commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
730	26	2.1.78	GADSHILL	on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
731	26	2.1.79	GADSHILL	her their boots.
732	27	2.1.80	Chamberlain	What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
733	27	2.1.81	Chamberlain	out water in foul way?
734	28	2.1.82	GADSHILL	She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
735	28	2.1.83	GADSHILL	steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
736	28	2.1.84	GADSHILL	of fern-seed, we walk invisible.
737	29	2.1.85	Chamberlain	Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
738	29	2.1.86	Chamberlain	the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
739	30	2.1.87	GADSHILL	Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
740	30	2.1.88	GADSHILL	purchase, as I am a true man.
741	31	2.1.89	Chamberlain	Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
742	32	2.1.90	GADSHILL	Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
743	32	2.1.91	GADSHILL	ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
744	32	2.1.92	GADSHILL	you muddy knave.
745	32		GADSHILL	Exeunt
746	32		GADSHILL	SCENE II. The highway, near Gadshill.
747	32		GADSHILL	Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
748	1	2.2.1	POINS	Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
749	1	2.2.2	POINS	horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.
750	2	2.2.3	PRINCE HENRY	Stand close.
751	2		PRINCE HENRY	Enter FALSTAFF
752	3	2.2.4	FALSTAFF	Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!
753	4	2.2.5	PRINCE HENRY	Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost
754	4	2.2.6	PRINCE HENRY	thou keep!
755	5	2.2.7	FALSTAFF	Where's Poins, Hal?
756	6	2.2.8	PRINCE HENRY	He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
757	7	2.2.9	FALSTAFF	I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
758	7	2.2.10	FALSTAFF	rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
759	7	2.2.11	FALSTAFF	not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
760	7	2.2.12	FALSTAFF	further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
761	7	2.2.13	FALSTAFF	not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
762	7	2.2.14	FALSTAFF	'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
763	7	2.2.15	FALSTAFF	forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
764	7	2.2.16	FALSTAFF	twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
765	7	2.2.17	FALSTAFF	rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
766	7	2.2.18	FALSTAFF	medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
767	7	2.2.19	FALSTAFF	could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
768	7	2.2.20	FALSTAFF	Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
769	7	2.2.21	FALSTAFF	I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
770	7	2.2.22	FALSTAFF	not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
771	7	2.2.23	FALSTAFF	leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
772	7	2.2.24	FALSTAFF	ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
773	7	2.2.25	FALSTAFF	ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
774	7	2.2.26	FALSTAFF	and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
775	7	2.2.27	FALSTAFF	a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
776	7		FALSTAFF	They whistle
777	7	2.2.28	FALSTAFF	Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
778	7	2.2.29	FALSTAFF	rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!
779	8	2.2.30	PRINCE HENRY	Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
780	8	2.2.31	PRINCE HENRY	to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
781	8	2.2.32	PRINCE HENRY	of travellers.
782	9	2.2.33	FALSTAFF	Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
783	9	2.2.34	FALSTAFF	'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
784	9	2.2.35	FALSTAFF	again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
785	9	2.2.36	FALSTAFF	What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
786	10	2.2.37	PRINCE HENRY	Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
787	11	2.2.38	FALSTAFF	I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
788	11	2.2.39	FALSTAFF	good king's son.
789	12	2.2.40	PRINCE HENRY	Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?
790	13	2.2.41	FALSTAFF	Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
791	13	2.2.42	FALSTAFF	garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
792	13	2.2.43	FALSTAFF	have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
793	13	2.2.44	FALSTAFF	tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
794	13	2.2.45	FALSTAFF	is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.
795	13		FALSTAFF	Enter GADSHILL, BARDOLPH and PETO
796	14	2.2.46	GADSHILL	Stand.
797	15	2.2.47	FALSTAFF	So I do, against my will.
798	16	2.2.48	POINS	O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,
799	16	2.2.49	POINS	what news?
800	17	2.2.50	BARDOLPH	Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's
801	17	2.2.51	BARDOLPH	money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
802	17	2.2.52	BARDOLPH	to the king's exchequer.
803	18	2.2.53	FALSTAFF	You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.
804	19	2.2.54	GADSHILL	There's enough to make us all.
805	20	2.2.55	FALSTAFF	To be hanged.
806	21	2.2.56	PRINCE HENRY	Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;
807	21	2.2.57	PRINCE HENRY	Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
808	21	2.2.58	PRINCE HENRY	from your encounter, then they light on us.
809	22	2.2.59	PETO	How many be there of them?
810	23	2.2.60	GADSHILL	Some eight or ten.
811	24	2.2.61	FALSTAFF	'Zounds, will they not rob us?
812	25	2.2.62	PRINCE HENRY	What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
813	26	2.2.63	FALSTAFF	Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;
814	26	2.2.64	FALSTAFF	but yet no coward, Hal.
815	27	2.2.65	PRINCE HENRY	Well, we leave that to the proof.
816	28	2.2.66	POINS	Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
817	28	2.2.67	POINS	when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.
818	28	2.2.68	POINS	Farewell, and stand fast.
819	29	2.2.69	FALSTAFF	Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.
820	30	2.2.70	PRINCE HENRY	Ned, where are our disguises?
821	31	2.2.71	POINS	Here, hard by: stand close.
822	31		POINS	Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS
823	32	2.2.72	FALSTAFF	Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
824	32	2.2.73	FALSTAFF	every man to his business.
825	32		FALSTAFF	Enter the Travellers
826	33	2.2.74	First Traveller	Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down
827	33	2.2.75	First Traveller	the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.
828	34	2.2.76	Thieves	Stand!
829	35	2.2.77	Travellers	Jesus bless us!
830	36	2.2.78	FALSTAFF	Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
831	36	2.2.79	FALSTAFF	ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
832	36	2.2.80	FALSTAFF	hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.
833	37	2.2.81	Travellers	O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
834	38	2.2.82	FALSTAFF	Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
835	38	2.2.83	FALSTAFF	fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
836	38	2.2.84	FALSTAFF	bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
837	38	2.2.85	FALSTAFF	You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.
838	38		FALSTAFF	Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt
839	38		FALSTAFF	Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
840	39	2.2.86	PRINCE HENRY	The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
841	39	2.2.87	PRINCE HENRY	and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
842	39	2.2.88	PRINCE HENRY	would be argument for a week, laughter for a month
843	39	2.2.89	PRINCE HENRY	and a good jest for ever.
844	40	2.2.90	POINS	Stand close; I hear them coming.
845	40		POINS	Enter the Thieves again
846	41	2.2.91	FALSTAFF	Come, my masters, let us share, and then to  horse
847	41	2.2.92	FALSTAFF	before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
848	41	2.2.93	FALSTAFF	arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
849	41	2.2.94	FALSTAFF	no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
850	42	2.2.95	PRINCE HENRY	Your money!
851	43	2.2.96	POINS	Villains!
852	43	2.2.96	POINS	As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon  them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them
853	44	2.2.97	PRINCE HENRY	Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
854	44	2.2.98	PRINCE HENRY	The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
855	44	2.2.99	PRINCE HENRY	So strongly that they dare not meet each other;
856	44	2.2.100	PRINCE HENRY	Each takes his fellow for an officer.
857	44	2.2.101	PRINCE HENRY	Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,
858	44	2.2.102	PRINCE HENRY	And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
859	44	2.2.103	PRINCE HENRY	Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.
860	45	2.2.104	POINS	How the rogue roar'd!
861	45		POINS	Exeunt
862	45		POINS	SCENE III. Warkworth castle
863	45		POINS	Enter HOTSPUR, solus, reading a letter
864	1	2.3.1	HOTSPUR	'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well
865	1	2.3.2	HOTSPUR	contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear
866	1	2.3.3	HOTSPUR	your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,
867	1	2.3.4	HOTSPUR	then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
868	1	2.3.5	HOTSPUR	he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
869	1	2.3.6	HOTSPUR	he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
870	1	2.3.7	HOTSPUR	purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's
871	1	2.3.8	HOTSPUR	certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
872	1	2.3.9	HOTSPUR	drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
873	1	2.3.10	HOTSPUR	nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
874	1	2.3.11	HOTSPUR	purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
875	1	2.3.12	HOTSPUR	have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
876	1	2.3.13	HOTSPUR	your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
877	1	2.3.14	HOTSPUR	great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say
878	1	2.3.15	HOTSPUR	unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
879	1	2.3.16	HOTSPUR	you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
880	1	2.3.17	HOTSPUR	our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
881	1	2.3.18	HOTSPUR	friends true and constant: a good plot, good
882	1	2.3.19	HOTSPUR	friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
883	1	2.3.20	HOTSPUR	very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
884	1	2.3.21	HOTSPUR	this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
885	1	2.3.22	HOTSPUR	general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by
886	1	2.3.23	HOTSPUR	this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.
887	1	2.3.24	HOTSPUR	Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
888	1	2.3.25	HOTSPUR	Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
889	1	2.3.26	HOTSPUR	is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
890	1	2.3.27	HOTSPUR	their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
891	1	2.3.28	HOTSPUR	next month? and are they not some of them set
892	1	2.3.29	HOTSPUR	forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
893	1	2.3.30	HOTSPUR	infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
894	1	2.3.31	HOTSPUR	of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
895	1	2.3.32	HOTSPUR	open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
896	1	2.3.33	HOTSPUR	and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
897	1	2.3.34	HOTSPUR	skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
898	1	2.3.35	HOTSPUR	let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
899	1	2.3.36	HOTSPUR	forward to-night.
900	1		HOTSPUR	Enter LADY PERCY
901	1	2.3.37	HOTSPUR	How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.
902	2	2.3.38	LADY PERCY	O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
903	2	2.3.39	LADY PERCY	For what offence have I this fortnight been
904	2	2.3.40	LADY PERCY	A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
905	2	2.3.41	LADY PERCY	Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
906	2	2.3.42	LADY PERCY	Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
907	2	2.3.43	LADY PERCY	Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
908	2	2.3.44	LADY PERCY	And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
909	2	2.3.45	LADY PERCY	Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
910	2	2.3.46	LADY PERCY	And given my treasures and my rights of thee
911	2	2.3.47	LADY PERCY	To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
912	2	2.3.48	LADY PERCY	In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
913	2	2.3.49	LADY PERCY	And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
914	2	2.3.50	LADY PERCY	Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
915	2	2.3.51	LADY PERCY	Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
916	2	2.3.52	LADY PERCY	Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
917	2	2.3.53	LADY PERCY	Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
918	2	2.3.54	LADY PERCY	Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
919	2	2.3.55	LADY PERCY	Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
920	2	2.3.56	LADY PERCY	And all the currents of a heady fight.
921	2	2.3.57	LADY PERCY	Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
922	2	2.3.58	LADY PERCY	And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
923	2	2.3.59	LADY PERCY	That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
924	2	2.3.60	LADY PERCY	Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
925	2	2.3.61	LADY PERCY	And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
926	2	2.3.62	LADY PERCY	Such as we see when men restrain their breath
927	2	2.3.63	LADY PERCY	On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
928	2	2.3.64	LADY PERCY	Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
929	2	2.3.65	LADY PERCY	And I must know it, else he loves me not.
930	3	2.3.66	HOTSPUR	What, ho!
931	3		HOTSPUR	Enter Servant
932	3	2.3.67	HOTSPUR	Is Gilliams with the packet gone?
933	4	2.3.68	Servant	He is, my lord, an hour ago.
934	5	2.3.69	HOTSPUR	Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
935	6	2.3.70	Servant	One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
936	7	2.3.71	HOTSPUR	What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
937	8	2.3.72	Servant	It is, my lord.
938	9	2.3.73	HOTSPUR	That roan shall by my throne.
939	9	2.3.74	HOTSPUR	Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
940	9	2.3.75	HOTSPUR	Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.
941	9		HOTSPUR	Exit Servant
942	10	2.3.76	LADY PERCY	But hear you, my lord.
943	11	2.3.77	HOTSPUR	What say'st thou, my lady?
944	12	2.3.78	LADY PERCY	What is it carries you away?
945	13	2.3.79	HOTSPUR	Why, my horse, my love, my horse.
946	14	2.3.80	LADY PERCY	Out, you mad-headed ape!
947	14	2.3.81	LADY PERCY	A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
948	14	2.3.82	LADY PERCY	As you are toss'd with. In faith,
949	14	2.3.83	LADY PERCY	I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
950	14	2.3.84	LADY PERCY	I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
951	14	2.3.85	LADY PERCY	About his title, and hath sent for you
952	14	2.3.86	LADY PERCY	To line his enterprise: but if you go,--
953	15	2.3.87	HOTSPUR	So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
954	16	2.3.88	LADY PERCY	Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
955	16	2.3.89	LADY PERCY	Directly unto this question that I ask:
956	16	2.3.90	LADY PERCY	In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
957	16	2.3.91	LADY PERCY	An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
958	17	2.3.92	HOTSPUR	Away,
959	17	2.3.93	HOTSPUR	Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
960	17	2.3.94	HOTSPUR	I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
961	17	2.3.95	HOTSPUR	To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
962	17	2.3.96	HOTSPUR	We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
963	17	2.3.97	HOTSPUR	And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
964	17	2.3.98	HOTSPUR	What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou
965	17	2.3.99	HOTSPUR	have with me?
966	18	2.3.100	LADY PERCY	Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
967	18	2.3.101	LADY PERCY	Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
968	18	2.3.102	LADY PERCY	I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
969	18	2.3.103	LADY PERCY	Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
970	19	2.3.104	HOTSPUR	Come, wilt thou see me ride?
971	19	2.3.105	HOTSPUR	And when I am on horseback, I will swear
972	19	2.3.106	HOTSPUR	I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
973	19	2.3.107	HOTSPUR	I must not have you henceforth question me
974	19	2.3.108	HOTSPUR	Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
975	19	2.3.109	HOTSPUR	Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
976	19	2.3.110	HOTSPUR	This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
977	19	2.3.111	HOTSPUR	I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
978	19	2.3.112	HOTSPUR	Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
979	19	2.3.113	HOTSPUR	But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
980	19	2.3.114	HOTSPUR	No lady closer; for I well believe
981	19	2.3.115	HOTSPUR	Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
982	19	2.3.116	HOTSPUR	And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
983	20	2.3.117	LADY PERCY	How! so far?
984	21	2.3.118	HOTSPUR	Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
985	21	2.3.119	HOTSPUR	Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
986	21	2.3.120	HOTSPUR	To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
987	21	2.3.121	HOTSPUR	Will this content you, Kate?
988	22	2.3.122	LADY PERCY	It must of force.
989	22		LADY PERCY	Exeunt
990	22		LADY PERCY	SCENE IV. The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap.
991	22		LADY PERCY	Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
992	1	2.4.1	PRINCE HENRY	Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me
993	1	2.4.2	PRINCE HENRY	thy hand to laugh a little.
994	2	2.4.3	POINS	Where hast been, Hal?
995	3	2.4.4	PRINCE HENRY	With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
996	3	2.4.5	PRINCE HENRY	score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
997	3	2.4.6	PRINCE HENRY	base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
998	3	2.4.7	PRINCE HENRY	to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
999	3	2.4.8	PRINCE HENRY	their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
1000	3	2.4.9	PRINCE HENRY	They take it already upon their salvation, that
1001	3	2.4.10	PRINCE HENRY	though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
1002	3	2.4.11	PRINCE HENRY	of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
1003	3	2.4.12	PRINCE HENRY	like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
1004	3	2.4.13	PRINCE HENRY	good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
1005	3	2.4.14	PRINCE HENRY	am king of England, I shall command all the good
1006	3	2.4.15	PRINCE HENRY	lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
1007	3	2.4.16	PRINCE HENRY	scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they
1008	3	2.4.17	PRINCE HENRY	cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
1009	3	2.4.18	PRINCE HENRY	am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
1010	3	2.4.19	PRINCE HENRY	that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
1011	3	2.4.20	PRINCE HENRY	during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
1012	3	2.4.21	PRINCE HENRY	much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
1013	3	2.4.22	PRINCE HENRY	action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
1014	3	2.4.23	PRINCE HENRY	Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
1015	3	2.4.24	PRINCE HENRY	even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
1016	3	2.4.25	PRINCE HENRY	never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
1017	3	2.4.26	PRINCE HENRY	shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with
1018	3	2.4.27	PRINCE HENRY	this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
1019	3	2.4.28	PRINCE HENRY	of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
1020	3	2.4.29	PRINCE HENRY	drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
1021	3	2.4.30	PRINCE HENRY	do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
1022	3	2.4.31	PRINCE HENRY	puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
1023	3	2.4.32	PRINCE HENRY	thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
1024	3	2.4.33	PRINCE HENRY	to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
1025	3	2.4.34	PRINCE HENRY	I'll show thee a precedent.
1026	4	2.4.35	POINS	Francis!
1027	5	2.4.36	PRINCE HENRY	Thou art perfect.
1028	6	2.4.37	POINS	Francis!
1029	6		POINS	Exit POINS
1030	6		POINS	Enter FRANCIS
1031	7	2.4.38	FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir. Look down into the Pomgarnet, Ralph.
1032	8	2.4.39	PRINCE HENRY	Come hither, Francis.
1033	9	2.4.40	FRANCIS	My lord?
1034	10	2.4.41	PRINCE HENRY	How long hast thou to serve, Francis?
1035	11	2.4.42	FRANCIS	Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--
1036	12	2.4.43	POINS	[Within]  Francis!
1037	13	2.4.44	FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir.
1038	14	2.4.45	PRINCE HENRY	Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking
1039	14	2.4.46	PRINCE HENRY	of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
1040	14	2.4.47	PRINCE HENRY	as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
1041	14	2.4.48	PRINCE HENRY	a fair pair of heels and run from it?
1042	15	2.4.49	FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in
1043	15	2.4.50	FRANCIS	England, I could find in my heart.
1044	16	2.4.51	POINS	[Within]  Francis!
1045	17	2.4.52	FRANCIS	Anon, sir.
1046	18	2.4.53	PRINCE HENRY	How old art thou, Francis?
1047	19	2.4.54	FRANCIS	Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--
1048	20	2.4.55	POINS	[Within]  Francis!
1049	21	2.4.56	FRANCIS	Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.
1050	22	2.4.57	PRINCE HENRY	Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou
1051	22	2.4.58	PRINCE HENRY	gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?
1052	23	2.4.59	FRANCIS	O Lord, I would it had been two!
1053	24	2.4.60	PRINCE HENRY	I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
1054	24	2.4.61	PRINCE HENRY	when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.
1055	25	2.4.62	POINS	[Within]  Francis!
1056	26	2.4.63	FRANCIS	Anon, anon.
1057	27	2.4.64	PRINCE HENRY	Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis;
1058	27	2.4.65	PRINCE HENRY	or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when
1059	27	2.4.66	PRINCE HENRY	thou wilt. But, Francis!
1060	28	2.4.67	FRANCIS	My lord?
1061	29	2.4.68	PRINCE HENRY	Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,
1062	29	2.4.69	PRINCE HENRY	not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
1063	29	2.4.70	PRINCE HENRY	smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--
1064	30	2.4.71	FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
1065	31	2.4.72	PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;
1066	31	2.4.73	PRINCE HENRY	for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
1067	31	2.4.74	PRINCE HENRY	will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.
1068	32	2.4.75	FRANCIS	What, sir?
1069	33	2.4.76	POINS	[Within]  Francis!
1070	34	2.4.77	PRINCE HENRY	Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?
1071	34	2.4.77	PRINCE HENRY	Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed, not knowing which way to go
1072	34		PRINCE HENRY	Enter Vintner
1073	35	2.4.78	Vintner	What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
1074	35	2.4.79	Vintner	calling? Look to the guests within.
1075	35		Vintner	Exit Francis
1076	35	2.4.80	Vintner	My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are
1077	35	2.4.81	Vintner	at the door: shall I let them in?
1078	36	2.4.82	PRINCE HENRY	Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.
1079	36		PRINCE HENRY	Exit Vintner
1080	36	2.4.83	PRINCE HENRY	Poins!
1081	36		PRINCE HENRY	Re-enter POINS
1082	37	2.4.84	POINS	Anon, anon, sir.
1083	38	2.4.85	PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at
1084	38	2.4.86	PRINCE HENRY	the door: shall we be merry?
1085	39	2.4.87	POINS	As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
1086	39	2.4.88	POINS	cunning match have you made with this jest of the
1087	39	2.4.89	POINS	drawer? come, what's the issue?
1088	40	2.4.90	PRINCE HENRY	I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
1089	40	2.4.91	PRINCE HENRY	humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
1090	40	2.4.92	PRINCE HENRY	pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.
1091	40		PRINCE HENRY	Re-enter FRANCIS
1092	40	2.4.93	PRINCE HENRY	What's o'clock, Francis?
1093	41	2.4.94	FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir.
1094	41		FRANCIS	Exit
1095	42	2.4.95	PRINCE HENRY	That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
1096	42	2.4.96	PRINCE HENRY	parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
1097	42	2.4.97	PRINCE HENRY	upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
1098	42	2.4.98	PRINCE HENRY	a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
1099	42	2.4.99	PRINCE HENRY	Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
1100	42	2.4.100	PRINCE HENRY	seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
1101	42	2.4.101	PRINCE HENRY	hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet
1102	42	2.4.102	PRINCE HENRY	life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
1103	42	2.4.103	PRINCE HENRY	'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
1104	42	2.4.104	PRINCE HENRY	horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some
1105	42	2.4.105	PRINCE HENRY	fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
1106	42	2.4.106	PRINCE HENRY	prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and
1107	42	2.4.107	PRINCE HENRY	that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
1108	42	2.4.108	PRINCE HENRY	wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.
1109	42	2.4.108	PRINCE HENRY	Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO; FRANCIS following with wine
1110	43	2.4.109	POINS	Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?
1111	44	2.4.110	FALSTAFF	A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
1112	44	2.4.111	FALSTAFF	marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
1113	44	2.4.112	FALSTAFF	lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
1114	44	2.4.113	FALSTAFF	them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
1115	44	2.4.114	FALSTAFF	Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
1116	44		FALSTAFF	He drinks
1117	45	2.4.115	PRINCE HENRY	Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
1118	45	2.4.116	PRINCE HENRY	pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
1119	45	2.4.117	PRINCE HENRY	of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.
1120	46	2.4.118	FALSTAFF	You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
1121	46	2.4.119	FALSTAFF	nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
1122	46	2.4.120	FALSTAFF	yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
1123	46	2.4.121	FALSTAFF	in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
1124	46	2.4.122	FALSTAFF	die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
1125	46	2.4.123	FALSTAFF	not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
1126	46	2.4.124	FALSTAFF	shotten herring. There live not three good men
1127	46	2.4.125	FALSTAFF	unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
1128	46	2.4.126	FALSTAFF	grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
1129	46	2.4.127	FALSTAFF	I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
1130	46	2.4.128	FALSTAFF	thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.
1131	47	2.4.129	PRINCE HENRY	How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?
1132	48	2.4.130	FALSTAFF	A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
1133	48	2.4.131	FALSTAFF	kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
1134	48	2.4.132	FALSTAFF	subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
1135	48	2.4.133	FALSTAFF	I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!
1136	49	2.4.134	PRINCE HENRY	Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
1137	50	2.4.135	FALSTAFF	Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?
1138	51	2.4.136	POINS	'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
1139	51	2.4.137	POINS	Lord, I'll stab thee.
1140	52	2.4.138	FALSTAFF	I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
1141	52	2.4.139	FALSTAFF	thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
1142	52	2.4.140	FALSTAFF	could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
1143	52	2.4.141	FALSTAFF	enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
1144	52	2.4.142	FALSTAFF	back: call you that backing of your friends? A
1145	52	2.4.143	FALSTAFF	plague upon such backing! give me them that will
1146	52	2.4.144	FALSTAFF	face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
1147	52	2.4.145	FALSTAFF	drunk to-day.
1148	53	2.4.146	PRINCE HENRY	O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
1149	53	2.4.147	PRINCE HENRY	drunkest last.
1150	54	2.4.148	FALSTAFF	All's one for that.
1151	54		FALSTAFF	He drinks
1152	54	2.4.149	FALSTAFF	A plague of all cowards, still say I.
1153	55	2.4.150	PRINCE HENRY	What's the matter?
1154	56	2.4.151	FALSTAFF	What's the matter! there be four of us here have
1155	56	2.4.152	FALSTAFF	ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.
1156	57	2.4.153	PRINCE HENRY	Where is it, Jack? where is it?
1157	58	2.4.154	FALSTAFF	Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
1158	58	2.4.155	FALSTAFF	poor four of us.
1159	59	2.4.156	PRINCE HENRY	What, a hundred, man?
1160	60	2.4.157	FALSTAFF	I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
1161	60	2.4.158	FALSTAFF	dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
1162	60	2.4.159	FALSTAFF	miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
1163	60	2.4.160	FALSTAFF	doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
1164	60	2.4.161	FALSTAFF	through and through; my sword hacked like a
1165	60	2.4.162	FALSTAFF	hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
1166	60	2.4.163	FALSTAFF	I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
1167	60	2.4.164	FALSTAFF	cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
1168	60	2.4.165	FALSTAFF	less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
1169	61	2.4.166	PRINCE HENRY	Speak, sirs; how was it?
1170	62	2.4.167	GADSHILL	We four set upon some dozen--
1171	63	2.4.168	FALSTAFF	Sixteen at least, my lord.
1172	64	2.4.169	GADSHILL	And bound them.
1173	65	2.4.170	PETO	No, no, they were not bound.
1174	66	2.4.171	FALSTAFF	You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
1175	66	2.4.172	FALSTAFF	am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
1176	67	2.4.173	GADSHILL	As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--
1177	68	2.4.174	FALSTAFF	And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
1178	69	2.4.175	PRINCE HENRY	What, fought you with them all?
1179	70	2.4.176	FALSTAFF	All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
1180	70	2.4.177	FALSTAFF	not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
1181	70	2.4.178	FALSTAFF	there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
1182	70	2.4.179	FALSTAFF	Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
1183	71	2.4.180	PRINCE HENRY	Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
1184	72	2.4.181	FALSTAFF	Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
1185	72	2.4.182	FALSTAFF	of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
1186	72	2.4.183	FALSTAFF	in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
1187	72	2.4.184	FALSTAFF	thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
1188	72	2.4.185	FALSTAFF	knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
1189	72	2.4.186	FALSTAFF	point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
1190	73	2.4.187	PRINCE HENRY	What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
1191	74	2.4.188	FALSTAFF	Four, Hal; I told thee four.
1192	75	2.4.189	POINS	Ay, ay, he said four.
1193	76	2.4.190	FALSTAFF	These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
1194	76	2.4.191	FALSTAFF	me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
1195	76	2.4.192	FALSTAFF	points in my target, thus.
1196	77	2.4.193	PRINCE HENRY	Seven? why, there were but four even now.
1197	78	2.4.194	FALSTAFF	In buckram?
1198	79	2.4.195	POINS	Ay, four, in buckram suits.
1199	80	2.4.196	FALSTAFF	Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
1200	81	2.4.197	PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.
1201	82	2.4.198	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear me, Hal?
1202	83	2.4.199	PRINCE HENRY	Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
1203	84	2.4.200	FALSTAFF	Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
1204	84	2.4.201	FALSTAFF	in buckram that I told thee of--
1205	85	2.4.202	PRINCE HENRY	So, two more already.
1206	86	2.4.203	FALSTAFF	Their points being broken,--
1207	87	2.4.204	POINS	Down fell their hose.
1208	88	2.4.205	FALSTAFF	Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
1209	88	2.4.206	FALSTAFF	came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
1210	88	2.4.207	FALSTAFF	the eleven I paid.
1211	89	2.4.208	PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
1212	90	2.4.209	FALSTAFF	But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
1213	90	2.4.210	FALSTAFF	knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
1214	90	2.4.211	FALSTAFF	at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
1215	90	2.4.212	FALSTAFF	not see thy hand.
1216	91	2.4.213	PRINCE HENRY	These lies are like their father that begets them;
1217	91	2.4.214	PRINCE HENRY	gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
1218	91	2.4.215	PRINCE HENRY	clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
1219	91	2.4.216	PRINCE HENRY	whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--
1220	92	2.4.217	FALSTAFF	What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
1221	92	2.4.218	FALSTAFF	the truth?
1222	93	2.4.219	PRINCE HENRY	Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
1223	93	2.4.220	PRINCE HENRY	green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
1224	93	2.4.221	PRINCE HENRY	hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?
1225	94	2.4.222	POINS	Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
1226	95	2.4.223	FALSTAFF	What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
1227	95	2.4.224	FALSTAFF	strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
1228	95	2.4.225	FALSTAFF	not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
1229	95	2.4.226	FALSTAFF	compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
1230	95	2.4.227	FALSTAFF	blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
1231	95	2.4.228	FALSTAFF	compulsion, I.
1232	96	2.4.229	PRINCE HENRY	I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
1233	96	2.4.230	PRINCE HENRY	coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
1234	96	2.4.231	PRINCE HENRY	this huge hill of flesh,--
1235	97	2.4.232	FALSTAFF	'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
1236	97	2.4.233	FALSTAFF	neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
1237	97	2.4.234	FALSTAFF	for breath to utter what is like thee! you
1238	97	2.4.235	FALSTAFF	tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
1239	97	2.4.236	FALSTAFF	standing-tuck,--
1240	98	2.4.237	PRINCE HENRY	Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
1241	98	2.4.238	PRINCE HENRY	when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
1242	98	2.4.239	PRINCE HENRY	hear me speak but this.
1243	99	2.4.240	POINS	Mark, Jack.
1244	100	2.4.241	PRINCE HENRY	We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
1245	100	2.4.242	PRINCE HENRY	were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
1246	100	2.4.243	PRINCE HENRY	tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
1247	100	2.4.244	PRINCE HENRY	four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
1248	100	2.4.245	PRINCE HENRY	prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
1249	100	2.4.246	PRINCE HENRY	the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
1250	100	2.4.247	PRINCE HENRY	away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
1251	100	2.4.248	PRINCE HENRY	for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
1252	100	2.4.249	PRINCE HENRY	bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
1253	100	2.4.250	PRINCE HENRY	as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
1254	100	2.4.251	PRINCE HENRY	What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
1255	100	2.4.252	PRINCE HENRY	thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
1256	100	2.4.253	PRINCE HENRY	apparent shame?
1257	101	2.4.254	POINS	Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?
1258	102	2.4.255	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
1259	102	2.4.256	FALSTAFF	Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
1260	102	2.4.257	FALSTAFF	heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
1261	102	2.4.258	FALSTAFF	why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
1262	102	2.4.259	FALSTAFF	beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
1263	102	2.4.260	FALSTAFF	prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
1264	102	2.4.261	FALSTAFF	coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
1265	102	2.4.262	FALSTAFF	myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
1266	102	2.4.263	FALSTAFF	lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
1267	102	2.4.264	FALSTAFF	lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
1268	102	2.4.265	FALSTAFF	to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
1269	102	2.4.266	FALSTAFF	Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
1270	102	2.4.267	FALSTAFF	of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
1271	102	2.4.268	FALSTAFF	merry? shall we have a play extempore?
1272	103	2.4.269	PRINCE HENRY	Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.
1273	104	2.4.270	FALSTAFF	Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
1274	104		FALSTAFF	Enter Hostess
1275	105	2.4.271	Hostess	O Jesu, my lord the prince!
1276	106	2.4.272	PRINCE HENRY	How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
1277	106	2.4.273	PRINCE HENRY	me?
1278	107	2.4.274	Hostess	Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
1279	107	2.4.275	Hostess	door would speak with you: he says he comes from
1280	107	2.4.276	Hostess	your father.
1281	108	2.4.277	PRINCE HENRY	Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
1282	108	2.4.278	PRINCE HENRY	send him back again to my mother.
1283	109	2.4.279	FALSTAFF	What manner of man is he?
1284	110	2.4.280	Hostess	An old man.
1285	111	2.4.281	FALSTAFF	What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
1286	111	2.4.282	FALSTAFF	I give him his answer?
1287	112	2.4.283	PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, do, Jack.
1288	113	2.4.284	FALSTAFF	'Faith, and I'll send him packing.
1289	113		FALSTAFF	Exit FALSTAFF
1290	114	2.4.285	PRINCE HENRY	Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
1291	114	2.4.286	PRINCE HENRY	Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
1292	114	2.4.287	PRINCE HENRY	ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
1293	114	2.4.288	PRINCE HENRY	prince; no, fie!
1294	115	2.4.289	BARDOLPH	'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
1295	116	2.4.290	PRINCE HENRY	'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
1296	116	2.4.291	PRINCE HENRY	sword so hacked?
1297	117	2.4.292	PETO	Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
1298	117	2.4.293	PETO	swear truth out of England but he would make you
1299	117	2.4.294	PETO	believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
1300	118	2.4.295	BARDOLPH	Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
1301	118	2.4.296	BARDOLPH	make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
1302	118	2.4.297	BARDOLPH	with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
1303	118	2.4.298	BARDOLPH	did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
1304	118	2.4.299	BARDOLPH	to hear his monstrous devices.
1305	119	2.4.300	PRINCE HENRY	O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
1306	119	2.4.301	PRINCE HENRY	ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
1307	119	2.4.302	PRINCE HENRY	thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
1308	119	2.4.303	PRINCE HENRY	sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
1309	119	2.4.304	PRINCE HENRY	instinct hadst thou for it?
1310	120	2.4.305	BARDOLPH	My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
1311	120	2.4.306	BARDOLPH	these exhalations?
1312	121	2.4.307	PRINCE HENRY	I do.
1313	122	2.4.308	BARDOLPH	What think you they portend?
1314	123	2.4.309	PRINCE HENRY	Hot livers and cold purses.
1315	124	2.4.310	BARDOLPH	Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
1316	125	2.4.311	PRINCE HENRY	No, if rightly taken, halter.
1317	125		PRINCE HENRY	Re-enter FALSTAFF
1318	125	2.4.312	PRINCE HENRY	Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
1319	125	2.4.313	PRINCE HENRY	How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
1320	125	2.4.314	PRINCE HENRY	How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
1321	126	2.4.315	FALSTAFF	My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
1322	126	2.4.316	FALSTAFF	not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
1323	126	2.4.317	FALSTAFF	crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
1324	126	2.4.318	FALSTAFF	sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
1325	126	2.4.319	FALSTAFF	bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
1326	126	2.4.320	FALSTAFF	Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
1327	126	2.4.321	FALSTAFF	court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
1328	126	2.4.322	FALSTAFF	north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
1329	126	2.4.323	FALSTAFF	bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
1330	126	2.4.324	FALSTAFF	devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
1331	126	2.4.325	FALSTAFF	hook--what a plague call you him?
1332	127	2.4.326	POINS	O, Glendower.
1333	128	2.4.327	FALSTAFF	Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
1334	128	2.4.328	FALSTAFF	and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
1335	128	2.4.329	FALSTAFF	Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
1336	128	2.4.330	FALSTAFF	perpendicular,--
1337	129	2.4.331	PRINCE HENRY	He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
1338	129	2.4.332	PRINCE HENRY	kills a sparrow flying.
1339	130	2.4.333	FALSTAFF	You have hit it.
1340	131	2.4.334	PRINCE HENRY	So did he never the sparrow.
1341	132	2.4.335	FALSTAFF	Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.
1342	133	2.4.336	PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
1343	133	2.4.337	PRINCE HENRY	for running!
1344	134	2.4.338	FALSTAFF	O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.
1345	135	2.4.339	PRINCE HENRY	Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
1346	136	2.4.340	FALSTAFF	I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
1347	136	2.4.341	FALSTAFF	and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
1348	136	2.4.342	FALSTAFF	Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
1349	136	2.4.343	FALSTAFF	beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
1350	136	2.4.344	FALSTAFF	land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
1351	137	2.4.345	PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and
1352	137	2.4.346	PRINCE HENRY	this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
1353	137	2.4.347	PRINCE HENRY	as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.
1354	138	2.4.348	FALSTAFF	By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
1355	138	2.4.349	FALSTAFF	shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
1356	138	2.4.350	FALSTAFF	art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
1357	138	2.4.351	FALSTAFF	heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
1358	138	2.4.352	FALSTAFF	such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
1359	138	2.4.353	FALSTAFF	spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
1360	138	2.4.354	FALSTAFF	not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
1361	138	2.4.355	FALSTAFF	it?
1362	139	2.4.356	PRINCE HENRY	Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
1363	140	2.4.357	FALSTAFF	Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
1364	140	2.4.358	FALSTAFF	comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.
1365	141	2.4.359	PRINCE HENRY	Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
1366	141	2.4.360	PRINCE HENRY	particulars of my life.
1367	142	2.4.361	FALSTAFF	Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
1368	142	2.4.362	FALSTAFF	this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.
1369	143	2.4.363	PRINCE HENRY	Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
1370	143	2.4.364	PRINCE HENRY	sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
1371	143	2.4.365	PRINCE HENRY	crown for a pitiful bald crown!
1372	144	2.4.366	FALSTAFF	Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
1373	144	2.4.367	FALSTAFF	now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
1374	144	2.4.368	FALSTAFF	make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
1375	144	2.4.369	FALSTAFF	wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
1376	144	2.4.370	FALSTAFF	in King Cambyses' vein.
1377	145	2.4.371	PRINCE HENRY	Well, here is my leg.
1378	146	2.4.372	FALSTAFF	And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
1379	147	2.4.373	Hostess	O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
1380	148	2.4.374	FALSTAFF	Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.
1381	149	2.4.375	Hostess	O, the father, how he holds his countenance!
1382	150	2.4.376	FALSTAFF	For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
1383	150	2.4.377	FALSTAFF	For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
1384	151	2.4.378	Hostess	O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
1385	151	2.4.379	Hostess	players as ever I see!
1386	152	2.4.380	FALSTAFF	Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
1387	152	2.4.381	FALSTAFF	Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
1388	152	2.4.382	FALSTAFF	time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
1389	152	2.4.383	FALSTAFF	the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
1390	152	2.4.384	FALSTAFF	it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
1391	152	2.4.385	FALSTAFF	sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
1392	152	2.4.386	FALSTAFF	partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
1393	152	2.4.387	FALSTAFF	but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
1394	152	2.4.388	FALSTAFF	foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
1395	152	2.4.389	FALSTAFF	me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
1396	152	2.4.390	FALSTAFF	why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
1397	152	2.4.391	FALSTAFF	the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
1398	152	2.4.392	FALSTAFF	blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
1399	152	2.4.393	FALSTAFF	the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
1400	152	2.4.394	FALSTAFF	question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
1401	152	2.4.395	FALSTAFF	which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
1402	152	2.4.396	FALSTAFF	many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
1403	152	2.4.397	FALSTAFF	as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
1404	152	2.4.398	FALSTAFF	the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
1405	152	2.4.399	FALSTAFF	speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
1406	152	2.4.400	FALSTAFF	pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
1407	152	2.4.401	FALSTAFF	woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
1408	152	2.4.402	FALSTAFF	have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
1409	153	2.4.403	PRINCE HENRY	What manner of man, an it like your majesty?
1410	154	2.4.404	FALSTAFF	A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
1411	154	2.4.405	FALSTAFF	cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
1412	154	2.4.406	FALSTAFF	carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
1413	154	2.4.407	FALSTAFF	by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
1414	154	2.4.408	FALSTAFF	remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
1415	154	2.4.409	FALSTAFF	should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
1416	154	2.4.410	FALSTAFF	I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
1417	154	2.4.411	FALSTAFF	known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
1418	154	2.4.412	FALSTAFF	peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
1419	154	2.4.413	FALSTAFF	Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
1420	154	2.4.414	FALSTAFF	me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
1421	154	2.4.415	FALSTAFF	thou been this month?
1422	155	2.4.416	PRINCE HENRY	Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
1423	155	2.4.417	PRINCE HENRY	and I'll play my father.
1424	156	2.4.418	FALSTAFF	Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
1425	156	2.4.419	FALSTAFF	majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
1426	156	2.4.420	FALSTAFF	the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
1427	157	2.4.421	PRINCE HENRY	Well, here I am set.
1428	158	2.4.422	FALSTAFF	And here I stand: judge, my masters.
1429	159	2.4.423	PRINCE HENRY	Now, Harry, whence come you?
1430	160	2.4.424	FALSTAFF	My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
1431	161	2.4.425	PRINCE HENRY	The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
1432	162	2.4.426	FALSTAFF	'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
1433	162	2.4.427	FALSTAFF	ye for a young prince, i' faith.
1434	163	2.4.428	PRINCE HENRY	Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
1435	163	2.4.429	PRINCE HENRY	on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
1436	163	2.4.430	PRINCE HENRY	there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
1437	163	2.4.431	PRINCE HENRY	old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
1438	163	2.4.432	PRINCE HENRY	dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
1439	163	2.4.433	PRINCE HENRY	bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
1440	163	2.4.434	PRINCE HENRY	of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
1441	163	2.4.435	PRINCE HENRY	cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
1442	163	2.4.436	PRINCE HENRY	the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
1443	163	2.4.437	PRINCE HENRY	grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
1444	163	2.4.438	PRINCE HENRY	years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
1445	163	2.4.439	PRINCE HENRY	drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
1446	163	2.4.440	PRINCE HENRY	capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
1447	163	2.4.441	PRINCE HENRY	wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
1448	163	2.4.442	PRINCE HENRY	but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?
1449	164	2.4.443	FALSTAFF	I would your grace would take me with you: whom
1450	164	2.4.444	FALSTAFF	means your grace?
1451	165	2.4.445	PRINCE HENRY	That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
1452	165	2.4.446	PRINCE HENRY	Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
1453	166	2.4.447	FALSTAFF	My lord, the man I know.
1454	167	2.4.448	PRINCE HENRY	I know thou dost.
1455	168	2.4.449	FALSTAFF	But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
1456	168	2.4.450	FALSTAFF	were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
1457	168	2.4.451	FALSTAFF	more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
1458	168	2.4.452	FALSTAFF	that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
1459	168	2.4.453	FALSTAFF	that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
1460	168	2.4.454	FALSTAFF	God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
1461	168	2.4.455	FALSTAFF	sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
1462	168	2.4.456	FALSTAFF	to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
1463	168	2.4.457	FALSTAFF	are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
1464	168	2.4.458	FALSTAFF	banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
1465	168	2.4.459	FALSTAFF	Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
1466	168	2.4.460	FALSTAFF	valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
1467	168	2.4.461	FALSTAFF	being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
1468	168	2.4.462	FALSTAFF	thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
1469	168	2.4.463	FALSTAFF	company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
1470	169	2.4.464	PRINCE HENRY	I do, I will.
1471	169		PRINCE HENRY	A knocking heard
1472	169		PRINCE HENRY	Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH
1473	169		PRINCE HENRY	Re-enter BARDOLPH, running
1474	170	2.4.465	BARDOLPH	O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
1475	170	2.4.466	BARDOLPH	monstrous watch is at the door.
1476	171	2.4.467	FALSTAFF	Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
1477	171	2.4.468	FALSTAFF	say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
1478	171		FALSTAFF	Re-enter the Hostess
1479	172	2.4.469	Hostess	O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
1480	173	2.4.470	PRINCE HENRY	Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
1481	173	2.4.471	PRINCE HENRY	what's the matter?
1482	174	2.4.472	Hostess	The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
1483	174	2.4.473	Hostess	are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
1484	175	2.4.474	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
1485	175	2.4.475	FALSTAFF	gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
1486	175	2.4.476	FALSTAFF	without seeming so.
1487	176	2.4.477	PRINCE HENRY	And thou a natural coward, without instinct.
1488	177	2.4.478	FALSTAFF	I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
1489	177	2.4.479	FALSTAFF	so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
1490	177	2.4.480	FALSTAFF	as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
1491	177	2.4.481	FALSTAFF	I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
1492	178	2.4.482	PRINCE HENRY	Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
1493	178	2.4.483	PRINCE HENRY	above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
1494	178	2.4.484	PRINCE HENRY	conscience.
1495	179	2.4.485	FALSTAFF	Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
1496	179	2.4.486	FALSTAFF	therefore I'll hide me.
1497	180	2.4.487	PRINCE HENRY	Call in the sheriff.
1498	180		PRINCE HENRY	Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO
1499	180		PRINCE HENRY	Enter Sheriff and the Carrier
1500	180	2.4.488	PRINCE HENRY	Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
1501	181	2.4.489	Sheriff	First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
1502	181	2.4.490	Sheriff	Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
1503	182	2.4.491	PRINCE HENRY	What men?
1504	183	2.4.492	Sheriff	One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
1505	183	2.4.493	Sheriff	A gross fat man.
1506	184	2.4.494	Carrier	As fat as butter.
1507	185	2.4.495	PRINCE HENRY	The man, I do assure you, is not here;
1508	185	2.4.496	PRINCE HENRY	For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
1509	185	2.4.497	PRINCE HENRY	And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
1510	185	2.4.498	PRINCE HENRY	That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
1511	185	2.4.499	PRINCE HENRY	Send him to answer thee, or any man,
1512	185	2.4.500	PRINCE HENRY	For any thing he shall be charged withal:
1513	185	2.4.501	PRINCE HENRY	And so let me entreat you leave the house.
1514	186	2.4.502	Sheriff	I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
1515	186	2.4.503	Sheriff	Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
1516	187	2.4.504	PRINCE HENRY	It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
1517	187	2.4.505	PRINCE HENRY	He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
1518	188	2.4.506	Sheriff	Good night, my noble lord.
1519	189	2.4.507	PRINCE HENRY	I think it is good morrow, is it not?
1520	190	2.4.508	Sheriff	Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
1521	190		Sheriff	Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier
1522	191	2.4.509	PRINCE HENRY	This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
1523	191	2.4.510	PRINCE HENRY	call him forth.
1524	192	2.4.511	PETO	Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
1525	192	2.4.512	PETO	snorting like a horse.
1526	193	2.4.513	PRINCE HENRY	Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
1527	193		PRINCE HENRY	He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers
1528	193	2.4.514	PRINCE HENRY	What hast thou found?
1529	194	2.4.515	PETO	Nothing but papers, my lord.
1530	195	2.4.516	PRINCE HENRY	Let's see what they be: read them.
1531	196	2.4.517	PETO	[Reads]  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.
1532	196	2.4.518	PETO	Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
1533	196	2.4.519	PETO	Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
1534	196	2.4.520	PETO	Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
1535	196	2.4.521	PETO	Item, Bread,        ob.
1536	197	2.4.522	PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
1537	197	2.4.523	PRINCE HENRY	this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
1538	197	2.4.524	PRINCE HENRY	keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
1539	197	2.4.525	PRINCE HENRY	let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
1540	197	2.4.526	PRINCE HENRY	morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
1541	197	2.4.527	PRINCE HENRY	shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
1542	197	2.4.528	PRINCE HENRY	charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
1543	197	2.4.529	PRINCE HENRY	march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
1544	197	2.4.530	PRINCE HENRY	back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
1545	197	2.4.531	PRINCE HENRY	the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.
1546	197		PRINCE HENRY	Exeunt
1547	198	2.4.532	PETO	Good morrow, good my lord.
1548	198	2.4.532	PETO	ACT III
1549	198	2.4.532	PETO	SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
1550	198		PETO	Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER
1551	1	3.1.1	MORTIMER	These promises are fair, the parties sure,
1552	1	3.1.2	MORTIMER	And our induction full of prosperous hope.
1553	2	3.1.3	HOTSPUR	Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
1554	2	3.1.4	HOTSPUR	Will you sit down?
1555	2	3.1.5	HOTSPUR	And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
1556	2	3.1.6	HOTSPUR	I have forgot the map.
1557	3	3.1.7	GLENDOWER	No, here it is.
1558	3	3.1.8	GLENDOWER	Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
1559	3	3.1.9	GLENDOWER	For by that name as oft as Lancaster
1560	3	3.1.10	GLENDOWER	Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
1561	3	3.1.11	GLENDOWER	A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
1562	4	3.1.12	HOTSPUR	And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
1563	5	3.1.13	GLENDOWER	I cannot blame him: at my nativity
1564	5	3.1.14	GLENDOWER	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
1565	5	3.1.15	GLENDOWER	Of burning cressets; and at my birth
1566	5	3.1.16	GLENDOWER	The frame and huge foundation of the earth
1567	5	3.1.17	GLENDOWER	Shaked like a coward.
1568	6	3.1.18	HOTSPUR	Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
1569	6	3.1.19	HOTSPUR	your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
1570	6	3.1.20	HOTSPUR	had never been born.
1571	7	3.1.21	GLENDOWER	I say the earth did shake when I was born.
1572	8	3.1.22	HOTSPUR	And I say the earth was not of my mind,
1573	8	3.1.23	HOTSPUR	If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
1574	9	3.1.24	GLENDOWER	The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
1575	10	3.1.25	HOTSPUR	O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
1576	10	3.1.26	HOTSPUR	And not in fear of your nativity.
1577	10	3.1.27	HOTSPUR	Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
1578	10	3.1.28	HOTSPUR	In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
1579	10	3.1.29	HOTSPUR	Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
1580	10	3.1.30	HOTSPUR	By the imprisoning of unruly wind
1581	10	3.1.31	HOTSPUR	Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
1582	10	3.1.32	HOTSPUR	Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
1583	10	3.1.33	HOTSPUR	Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
1584	10	3.1.34	HOTSPUR	Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
1585	10	3.1.35	HOTSPUR	In passion shook.
1586	11	3.1.36	GLENDOWER	Cousin, of many men
1587	11	3.1.37	GLENDOWER	I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
1588	11	3.1.38	GLENDOWER	To tell you once again that at my birth
1589	11	3.1.39	GLENDOWER	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
1590	11	3.1.40	GLENDOWER	The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
1591	11	3.1.41	GLENDOWER	Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
1592	11	3.1.42	GLENDOWER	These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
1593	11	3.1.43	GLENDOWER	And all the courses of my life do show
1594	11	3.1.44	GLENDOWER	I am not in the roll of common men.
1595	11	3.1.45	GLENDOWER	Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
1596	11	3.1.46	GLENDOWER	That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
1597	11	3.1.47	GLENDOWER	Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
1598	11	3.1.48	GLENDOWER	And bring him out that is but woman's son
1599	11	3.1.49	GLENDOWER	Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
1600	11	3.1.50	GLENDOWER	And hold me pace in deep experiments.
1601	12	3.1.51	HOTSPUR	I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
1602	12	3.1.52	HOTSPUR	I'll to dinner.
1603	13	3.1.53	MORTIMER	Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
1604	14	3.1.54	GLENDOWER	I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
1605	15	3.1.55	HOTSPUR	Why, so can I, or so can any man;
1606	15	3.1.56	HOTSPUR	But will they come when you do call for them?
1607	16	3.1.57	GLENDOWER	Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
1608	16	3.1.58	GLENDOWER	The devil.
1609	17	3.1.59	HOTSPUR	And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
1610	17	3.1.60	HOTSPUR	By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
1611	17	3.1.61	HOTSPUR	If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
1612	17	3.1.62	HOTSPUR	And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
1613	17	3.1.63	HOTSPUR	O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
1614	18	3.1.64	MORTIMER	Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
1615	19	3.1.65	GLENDOWER	Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
1616	19	3.1.66	GLENDOWER	Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
1617	19	3.1.67	GLENDOWER	And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
1618	19	3.1.68	GLENDOWER	Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
1619	20	3.1.69	HOTSPUR	Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
1620	20	3.1.70	HOTSPUR	How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
1621	21	3.1.71	GLENDOWER	Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
1622	21	3.1.72	GLENDOWER	According to our threefold order ta'en?
1623	22	3.1.73	MORTIMER	The archdeacon hath divided it
1624	22	3.1.74	MORTIMER	Into three limits very equally:
1625	22	3.1.75	MORTIMER	England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
1626	22	3.1.76	MORTIMER	By south and east is to my part assign'd:
1627	22	3.1.77	MORTIMER	All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
1628	22	3.1.78	MORTIMER	And all the fertile land within that bound,
1629	22	3.1.79	MORTIMER	To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
1630	22	3.1.80	MORTIMER	The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
1631	22	3.1.81	MORTIMER	And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
1632	22	3.1.82	MORTIMER	Which being sealed interchangeably,
1633	22	3.1.83	MORTIMER	A business that this night may execute,
1634	22	3.1.84	MORTIMER	To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
1635	22	3.1.85	MORTIMER	And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
1636	22	3.1.86	MORTIMER	To meet your father and the Scottish power,
1637	22	3.1.87	MORTIMER	As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
1638	22	3.1.88	MORTIMER	My father Glendower is not ready yet,
1639	22	3.1.89	MORTIMER	Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
1640	22	3.1.90	MORTIMER	Within that space you may have drawn together
1641	22	3.1.91	MORTIMER	Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.
1642	23	3.1.92	GLENDOWER	A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
1643	23	3.1.93	GLENDOWER	And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
1644	23	3.1.94	GLENDOWER	From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
1645	23	3.1.95	GLENDOWER	For there will be a world of water shed
1646	23	3.1.96	GLENDOWER	Upon the parting of your wives and you.
1647	24	3.1.97	HOTSPUR	Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
1648	24	3.1.98	HOTSPUR	In quantity equals not one of yours:
1649	24	3.1.99	HOTSPUR	See how this river comes me cranking in,
1650	24	3.1.100	HOTSPUR	And cuts me from the best of all my land
1651	24	3.1.101	HOTSPUR	A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
1652	24	3.1.102	HOTSPUR	I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
1653	24	3.1.103	HOTSPUR	And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
1654	24	3.1.104	HOTSPUR	In a new channel, fair and evenly;
1655	24	3.1.105	HOTSPUR	It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
1656	24	3.1.106	HOTSPUR	To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
1657	25	3.1.107	GLENDOWER	Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
1658	26	3.1.108	MORTIMER	Yea, but
1659	26	3.1.109	MORTIMER	Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
1660	26	3.1.110	MORTIMER	With like advantage on the other side;
1661	26	3.1.111	MORTIMER	Gelding the opposed continent as much
1662	26	3.1.112	MORTIMER	As on the other side it takes from you.
1663	27	3.1.113	EARL OF WORCESTER	Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
1664	27	3.1.114	EARL OF WORCESTER	And on this north side win this cape of land;
1665	27	3.1.115	EARL OF WORCESTER	And then he runs straight and even.
1666	28	3.1.116	HOTSPUR	I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
1667	29	3.1.117	GLENDOWER	I'll not have it alter'd.
1668	30	3.1.118	HOTSPUR	Will not you?
1669	31	3.1.119	GLENDOWER	No, nor you shall not.
1670	32	3.1.120	HOTSPUR	Who shall say me nay?
1671	33	3.1.121	GLENDOWER	Why, that will I.
1672	34	3.1.122	HOTSPUR	Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.
1673	35	3.1.123	GLENDOWER	I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
1674	35	3.1.124	GLENDOWER	For I was train'd up in the English court;
1675	35	3.1.125	GLENDOWER	Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
1676	35	3.1.126	GLENDOWER	Many an English ditty lovely well
1677	35	3.1.127	GLENDOWER	And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
1678	35	3.1.128	GLENDOWER	A virtue that was never seen in you.
1679	36	3.1.129	HOTSPUR	Marry,
1680	36	3.1.130	HOTSPUR	And I am glad of it with all my heart:
1681	36	3.1.131	HOTSPUR	I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
1682	36	3.1.132	HOTSPUR	Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
1683	36	3.1.133	HOTSPUR	I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
1684	36	3.1.134	HOTSPUR	Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
1685	36	3.1.135	HOTSPUR	And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
1686	36	3.1.136	HOTSPUR	Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
1687	36	3.1.137	HOTSPUR	'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
1688	37	3.1.138	GLENDOWER	Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
1689	38	3.1.139	HOTSPUR	I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
1690	38	3.1.140	HOTSPUR	To any well-deserving friend;
1691	38	3.1.141	HOTSPUR	But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
1692	38	3.1.142	HOTSPUR	I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
1693	38	3.1.143	HOTSPUR	Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
1694	39	3.1.144	GLENDOWER	The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
1695	39	3.1.145	GLENDOWER	I'll haste the writer and withal
1696	39	3.1.146	GLENDOWER	Break with your wives of your departure hence:
1697	39	3.1.147	GLENDOWER	I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
1698	39	3.1.148	GLENDOWER	So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
1699	39		GLENDOWER	Exit GLENDOWER
1700	40	3.1.149	MORTIMER	Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
1701	41	3.1.150	HOTSPUR	I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
1702	41	3.1.151	HOTSPUR	With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
1703	41	3.1.152	HOTSPUR	Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
1704	41	3.1.153	HOTSPUR	And of a dragon and a finless fish,
1705	41	3.1.154	HOTSPUR	A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
1706	41	3.1.155	HOTSPUR	A couching lion and a ramping cat,
1707	41	3.1.156	HOTSPUR	And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
1708	41	3.1.157	HOTSPUR	As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
1709	41	3.1.158	HOTSPUR	He held me last night at least nine hours
1710	41	3.1.159	HOTSPUR	In reckoning up the several devils' names
1711	41	3.1.160	HOTSPUR	That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
1712	41	3.1.161	HOTSPUR	But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
1713	41	3.1.162	HOTSPUR	As a tired horse, a railing wife;
1714	41	3.1.163	HOTSPUR	Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
1715	41	3.1.164	HOTSPUR	With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
1716	41	3.1.165	HOTSPUR	Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
1717	41	3.1.166	HOTSPUR	In any summer-house in Christendom.
1718	42	3.1.167	MORTIMER	In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
1719	42	3.1.168	MORTIMER	Exceedingly well read, and profited
1720	42	3.1.169	MORTIMER	In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
1721	42	3.1.170	MORTIMER	And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
1722	42	3.1.171	MORTIMER	As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
1723	42	3.1.172	MORTIMER	He holds your temper in a high respect
1724	42	3.1.173	MORTIMER	And curbs himself even of his natural scope
1725	42	3.1.174	MORTIMER	When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
1726	42	3.1.175	MORTIMER	I warrant you, that man is not alive
1727	42	3.1.176	MORTIMER	Might so have tempted him as you have done,
1728	42	3.1.177	MORTIMER	Without the taste of danger and reproof:
1729	42	3.1.178	MORTIMER	But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
1730	43	3.1.179	EARL OF WORCESTER	In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
1731	43	3.1.180	EARL OF WORCESTER	And since your coming hither have done enough
1732	43	3.1.181	EARL OF WORCESTER	To put him quite beside his patience.
1733	43	3.1.182	EARL OF WORCESTER	You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
1734	43	3.1.183	EARL OF WORCESTER	Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
1735	43	3.1.184	EARL OF WORCESTER	And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
1736	43	3.1.185	EARL OF WORCESTER	Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
1737	43	3.1.186	EARL OF WORCESTER	Defect of manners, want of government,
1738	43	3.1.187	EARL OF WORCESTER	Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
1739	43	3.1.188	EARL OF WORCESTER	The least of which haunting a nobleman
1740	43	3.1.189	EARL OF WORCESTER	Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
1741	43	3.1.190	EARL OF WORCESTER	Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
1742	43	3.1.191	EARL OF WORCESTER	Beguiling them of commendation.
1743	44	3.1.192	HOTSPUR	Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!
1744	44	3.1.193	HOTSPUR	Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
1745	44		HOTSPUR	Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
1746	45	3.1.194	MORTIMER	This is the deadly spite that angers me;
1747	45	3.1.195	MORTIMER	My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
1748	46	3.1.196	GLENDOWER	My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
1749	46	3.1.197	GLENDOWER	She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
1750	47	3.1.198	MORTIMER	Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
1751	47	3.1.199	MORTIMER	Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
1752	47		MORTIMER	Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same
1753	48	3.1.200	GLENDOWER	She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
1754	48	3.1.201	GLENDOWER	one that no persuasion can do good upon.
1755	48		GLENDOWER	The lady speaks in Welsh
1756	49	3.1.202	MORTIMER	I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
1757	49	3.1.203	MORTIMER	Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
1758	49	3.1.204	MORTIMER	I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
1759	49	3.1.205	MORTIMER	In such a parley should I answer thee.
1760	49		MORTIMER	The lady speaks again in Welsh
1761	49	3.1.206	MORTIMER	I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
1762	49	3.1.207	MORTIMER	And that's a feeling disputation:
1763	49	3.1.208	MORTIMER	But I will never be a truant, love,
1764	49	3.1.209	MORTIMER	Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
1765	49	3.1.210	MORTIMER	Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
1766	49	3.1.211	MORTIMER	Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
1767	49	3.1.212	MORTIMER	With ravishing division, to her lute.
1768	50	3.1.213	GLENDOWER	Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
1769	50		GLENDOWER	The lady speaks again in Welsh
1770	51	3.1.214	MORTIMER	O, I am ignorance itself in this!
1771	52	3.1.215	GLENDOWER	She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
1772	52	3.1.216	GLENDOWER	And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
1773	52	3.1.217	GLENDOWER	And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
1774	52	3.1.218	GLENDOWER	And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
1775	52	3.1.219	GLENDOWER	Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
1776	52	3.1.220	GLENDOWER	Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
1777	52	3.1.221	GLENDOWER	As is the difference betwixt day and night
1778	52	3.1.222	GLENDOWER	The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
1779	52	3.1.223	GLENDOWER	Begins his golden progress in the east.
1780	53	3.1.224	MORTIMER	With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
1781	53	3.1.225	MORTIMER	By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
1782	54	3.1.226	GLENDOWER	Do so;
1783	54	3.1.227	GLENDOWER	And those musicians that shall play to you
1784	54	3.1.228	GLENDOWER	Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
1785	54	3.1.229	GLENDOWER	And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
1786	55	3.1.230	HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
1787	55	3.1.231	HOTSPUR	quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
1788	56	3.1.232	LADY PERCY	Go, ye giddy goose.
1789	56		LADY PERCY	The music plays
1790	57	3.1.233	HOTSPUR	Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
1791	57	3.1.234	HOTSPUR	And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
1792	57	3.1.235	HOTSPUR	By'r lady, he is a good musician.
1793	58	3.1.236	LADY PERCY	Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
1794	58	3.1.237	LADY PERCY	altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
1795	58	3.1.238	LADY PERCY	and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
1796	59	3.1.239	HOTSPUR	I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
1797	60	3.1.240	LADY PERCY	Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
1798	61	3.1.241	HOTSPUR	No.
1799	62	3.1.242	LADY PERCY	Then be still.
1800	63	3.1.243	HOTSPUR	Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
1801	64	3.1.244	LADY PERCY	Now God help thee!
1802	65	3.1.245	HOTSPUR	To the Welsh lady's bed.
1803	66	3.1.246	LADY PERCY	What's that?
1804	67	3.1.247	HOTSPUR	Peace! she sings.
1805	67		HOTSPUR	Here the lady sings a Welsh song
1806	68	3.1.248	HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
1807	69	3.1.249	LADY PERCY	Not mine, in good sooth.
1808	70	3.1.250	HOTSPUR	Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a
1809	70	3.1.251	HOTSPUR	comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
1810	70	3.1.252	HOTSPUR	'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
1811	70	3.1.253	HOTSPUR	'as sure as day,'
1812	70	3.1.254	HOTSPUR	And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
1813	70	3.1.255	HOTSPUR	As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
1814	70	3.1.256	HOTSPUR	Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
1815	70	3.1.257	HOTSPUR	A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
1816	70	3.1.258	HOTSPUR	And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
1817	70	3.1.259	HOTSPUR	To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
1818	70	3.1.260	HOTSPUR	Come, sing.
1819	71	3.1.261	LADY PERCY	I will not sing.
1820	72	3.1.262	HOTSPUR	'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
1821	72	3.1.263	HOTSPUR	teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
1822	72	3.1.264	HOTSPUR	within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.
1823	72		HOTSPUR	Exit
1824	73	3.1.265	GLENDOWER	Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
1825	73	3.1.266	GLENDOWER	As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
1826	73	3.1.267	GLENDOWER	By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
1827	73	3.1.268	GLENDOWER	And then to horse immediately.
1828	74	3.1.269	MORTIMER	With all my heart.
1829	74		MORTIMER	Exeunt
1830	74		MORTIMER	SCENE II. London. The palace.
1831	74		MORTIMER	Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others
1832	1	3.2.1	KING HENRY IV	Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
1833	1	3.2.2	KING HENRY IV	Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
1834	1	3.2.3	KING HENRY IV	For we shall presently have need of you.
1835	1		KING HENRY IV	Exeunt Lords
1836	1	3.2.4	KING HENRY IV	I know not whether God will have it so,
1837	1	3.2.5	KING HENRY IV	For some displeasing service I have done,
1838	1	3.2.6	KING HENRY IV	That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
1839	1	3.2.7	KING HENRY IV	He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
1840	1	3.2.8	KING HENRY IV	But thou dost in thy passages of life
1841	1	3.2.9	KING HENRY IV	Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
1842	1	3.2.10	KING HENRY IV	For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
1843	1	3.2.11	KING HENRY IV	To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
1844	1	3.2.12	KING HENRY IV	Could such inordinate and low desires,
1845	1	3.2.13	KING HENRY IV	Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
1846	1	3.2.14	KING HENRY IV	Such barren pleasures, rude society,
1847	1	3.2.15	KING HENRY IV	As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
1848	1	3.2.16	KING HENRY IV	Accompany the greatness of thy blood
1849	1	3.2.17	KING HENRY IV	And hold their level with thy princely heart?
1850	2	3.2.18	PRINCE HENRY	So please your majesty, I would I could
1851	2	3.2.19	PRINCE HENRY	Quit all offences with as clear excuse
1852	2	3.2.20	PRINCE HENRY	As well as I am doubtless I can purge
1853	2	3.2.21	PRINCE HENRY	Myself of many I am charged withal:
1854	2	3.2.22	PRINCE HENRY	Yet such extenuation let me beg,
1855	2	3.2.23	PRINCE HENRY	As, in reproof of many tales devised,
1856	2	3.2.24	PRINCE HENRY	which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
1857	2	3.2.25	PRINCE HENRY	By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
1858	2	3.2.26	PRINCE HENRY	I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
1859	2	3.2.27	PRINCE HENRY	Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
1860	2	3.2.28	PRINCE HENRY	Find pardon on my true submission.
1861	3	3.2.29	KING HENRY IV	God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
1862	3	3.2.30	KING HENRY IV	At thy affections, which do hold a wing
1863	3	3.2.31	KING HENRY IV	Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
1864	3	3.2.32	KING HENRY IV	Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
1865	3	3.2.33	KING HENRY IV	Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
1866	3	3.2.34	KING HENRY IV	And art almost an alien to the hearts
1867	3	3.2.35	KING HENRY IV	Of all the court and princes of my blood:
1868	3	3.2.36	KING HENRY IV	The hope and expectation of thy time
1869	3	3.2.37	KING HENRY IV	Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
1870	3	3.2.38	KING HENRY IV	Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
1871	3	3.2.39	KING HENRY IV	Had I so lavish of my presence been,
1872	3	3.2.40	KING HENRY IV	So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
1873	3	3.2.41	KING HENRY IV	So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
1874	3	3.2.42	KING HENRY IV	Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
1875	3	3.2.43	KING HENRY IV	Had still kept loyal to possession
1876	3	3.2.44	KING HENRY IV	And left me in reputeless banishment,
1877	3	3.2.45	KING HENRY IV	A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
1878	3	3.2.46	KING HENRY IV	By being seldom seen, I could not stir
1879	3	3.2.47	KING HENRY IV	But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
1880	3	3.2.48	KING HENRY IV	That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
1881	3	3.2.49	KING HENRY IV	Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
1882	3	3.2.50	KING HENRY IV	And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
1883	3	3.2.51	KING HENRY IV	And dress'd myself in such humility
1884	3	3.2.52	KING HENRY IV	That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
1885	3	3.2.53	KING HENRY IV	Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
1886	3	3.2.54	KING HENRY IV	Even in the presence of the crowned king.
1887	3	3.2.55	KING HENRY IV	Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
1888	3	3.2.56	KING HENRY IV	My presence, like a robe pontifical,
1889	3	3.2.57	KING HENRY IV	Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
1890	3	3.2.58	KING HENRY IV	Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
1891	3	3.2.59	KING HENRY IV	And won by rareness such solemnity.
1892	3	3.2.60	KING HENRY IV	The skipping king, he ambled up and down
1893	3	3.2.61	KING HENRY IV	With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
1894	3	3.2.62	KING HENRY IV	Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
1895	3	3.2.63	KING HENRY IV	Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
1896	3	3.2.64	KING HENRY IV	Had his great name profaned with their scorns
1897	3	3.2.65	KING HENRY IV	And gave his countenance, against his name,
1898	3	3.2.66	KING HENRY IV	To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
1899	3	3.2.67	KING HENRY IV	Of every beardless vain comparative,
1900	3	3.2.68	KING HENRY IV	Grew a companion to the common streets,
1901	3	3.2.69	KING HENRY IV	Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
1902	3	3.2.70	KING HENRY IV	That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
1903	3	3.2.71	KING HENRY IV	They surfeited with honey and began
1904	3	3.2.72	KING HENRY IV	To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
1905	3	3.2.73	KING HENRY IV	More than a little is by much too much.
1906	3	3.2.74	KING HENRY IV	So when he had occasion to be seen,
1907	3	3.2.75	KING HENRY IV	He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
1908	3	3.2.76	KING HENRY IV	Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
1909	3	3.2.77	KING HENRY IV	As, sick and blunted with community,
1910	3	3.2.78	KING HENRY IV	Afford no extraordinary gaze,
1911	3	3.2.79	KING HENRY IV	Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
1912	3	3.2.80	KING HENRY IV	When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
1913	3	3.2.81	KING HENRY IV	But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
1914	3	3.2.82	KING HENRY IV	Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
1915	3	3.2.83	KING HENRY IV	As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
1916	3	3.2.84	KING HENRY IV	Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
1917	3	3.2.85	KING HENRY IV	And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
1918	3	3.2.86	KING HENRY IV	For thou has lost thy princely privilege
1919	3	3.2.87	KING HENRY IV	With vile participation: not an eye
1920	3	3.2.88	KING HENRY IV	But is a-weary of thy common sight,
1921	3	3.2.89	KING HENRY IV	Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
1922	3	3.2.90	KING HENRY IV	Which now doth that I would not have it do,
1923	3	3.2.91	KING HENRY IV	Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
1924	4	3.2.92	PRINCE HENRY	I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
1925	4	3.2.93	PRINCE HENRY	Be more myself.
1926	5	3.2.94	KING HENRY IV	For all the world
1927	5	3.2.95	KING HENRY IV	As thou art to this hour was Richard then
1928	5	3.2.96	KING HENRY IV	When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
1929	5	3.2.97	KING HENRY IV	And even as I was then is Percy now.
1930	5	3.2.98	KING HENRY IV	Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
1931	5	3.2.99	KING HENRY IV	He hath more worthy interest to the state
1932	5	3.2.100	KING HENRY IV	Than thou the shadow of succession;
1933	5	3.2.101	KING HENRY IV	For of no right, nor colour like to right,
1934	5	3.2.102	KING HENRY IV	He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
1935	5	3.2.103	KING HENRY IV	Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
1936	5	3.2.104	KING HENRY IV	And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
1937	5	3.2.105	KING HENRY IV	Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
1938	5	3.2.106	KING HENRY IV	To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
1939	5	3.2.107	KING HENRY IV	What never-dying honour hath he got
1940	5	3.2.108	KING HENRY IV	Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
1941	5	3.2.109	KING HENRY IV	Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
1942	5	3.2.110	KING HENRY IV	Holds from all soldiers chief majority
1943	5	3.2.111	KING HENRY IV	And military title capital
1944	5	3.2.112	KING HENRY IV	Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
1945	5	3.2.113	KING HENRY IV	Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
1946	5	3.2.114	KING HENRY IV	This infant warrior, in his enterprises
1947	5	3.2.115	KING HENRY IV	Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
1948	5	3.2.116	KING HENRY IV	Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
1949	5	3.2.117	KING HENRY IV	To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
1950	5	3.2.118	KING HENRY IV	And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
1951	5	3.2.119	KING HENRY IV	And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
1952	5	3.2.120	KING HENRY IV	The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
1953	5	3.2.121	KING HENRY IV	Capitulate against us and are up.
1954	5	3.2.122	KING HENRY IV	But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
1955	5	3.2.123	KING HENRY IV	Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
1956	5	3.2.124	KING HENRY IV	Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
1957	5	3.2.125	KING HENRY IV	Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
1958	5	3.2.126	KING HENRY IV	Base inclination and the start of spleen
1959	5	3.2.127	KING HENRY IV	To fight against me under Percy's pay,
1960	5	3.2.128	KING HENRY IV	To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
1961	5	3.2.129	KING HENRY IV	To show how much thou art degenerate.
1962	6	3.2.130	PRINCE HENRY	Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
1963	6	3.2.131	PRINCE HENRY	And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
1964	6	3.2.132	PRINCE HENRY	Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
1965	6	3.2.133	PRINCE HENRY	I will redeem all this on Percy's head
1966	6	3.2.134	PRINCE HENRY	And in the closing of some glorious day
1967	6	3.2.135	PRINCE HENRY	Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
1968	6	3.2.136	PRINCE HENRY	When I will wear a garment all of blood
1969	6	3.2.137	PRINCE HENRY	And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
1970	6	3.2.138	PRINCE HENRY	Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
1971	6	3.2.139	PRINCE HENRY	And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
1972	6	3.2.140	PRINCE HENRY	That this same child of honour and renown,
1973	6	3.2.141	PRINCE HENRY	This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
1974	6	3.2.142	PRINCE HENRY	And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
1975	6	3.2.143	PRINCE HENRY	For every honour sitting on his helm,
1976	6	3.2.144	PRINCE HENRY	Would they were multitudes, and on my head
1977	6	3.2.145	PRINCE HENRY	My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
1978	6	3.2.146	PRINCE HENRY	That I shall make this northern youth exchange
1979	6	3.2.147	PRINCE HENRY	His glorious deeds for my indignities.
1980	6	3.2.148	PRINCE HENRY	Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
1981	6	3.2.149	PRINCE HENRY	To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
1982	6	3.2.150	PRINCE HENRY	And I will call him to so strict account,
1983	6	3.2.151	PRINCE HENRY	That he shall render every glory up,
1984	6	3.2.152	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
1985	6	3.2.153	PRINCE HENRY	Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
1986	6	3.2.154	PRINCE HENRY	This, in the name of God, I promise here:
1987	6	3.2.155	PRINCE HENRY	The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
1988	6	3.2.156	PRINCE HENRY	I do beseech your majesty may salve
1989	6	3.2.157	PRINCE HENRY	The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
1990	6	3.2.158	PRINCE HENRY	If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
1991	6	3.2.159	PRINCE HENRY	And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
1992	6	3.2.160	PRINCE HENRY	Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
1993	7	3.2.161	KING HENRY IV	A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
1994	7	3.2.162	KING HENRY IV	Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
1995	7		KING HENRY IV	Enter BLUNT
1996	7	3.2.163	KING HENRY IV	How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
1997	8	3.2.164	SIR WALTER BLUNT	So hath the business that I come to speak of.
1998	8	3.2.165	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
1999	8	3.2.166	SIR WALTER BLUNT	That Douglas and the English rebels met
2000	8	3.2.167	SIR WALTER BLUNT	The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
2001	8	3.2.168	SIR WALTER BLUNT	A mighty and a fearful head they are,
2002	8	3.2.169	SIR WALTER BLUNT	If promises be kept on every hand,
2003	8	3.2.170	SIR WALTER BLUNT	As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
2004	9	3.2.171	KING HENRY IV	The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
2005	9	3.2.172	KING HENRY IV	With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
2006	9	3.2.173	KING HENRY IV	For this advertisement is five days old:
2007	9	3.2.174	KING HENRY IV	On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
2008	9	3.2.175	KING HENRY IV	On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
2009	9	3.2.176	KING HENRY IV	Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march
2010	9	3.2.177	KING HENRY IV	Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
2011	9	3.2.178	KING HENRY IV	Our business valued, some twelve days hence
2012	9	3.2.179	KING HENRY IV	Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
2013	9	3.2.180	KING HENRY IV	Our hands are full of business: let's away;
2014	9	3.2.181	KING HENRY IV	Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.
2015	9		KING HENRY IV	Exeunt
2016	10			Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.
2017	10			Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
2018	11	3.2.183	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
2019	11	3.2.184	FALSTAFF	action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
2020	11	3.2.185	FALSTAFF	skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
2021	11	3.2.186	FALSTAFF	gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
2022	11	3.2.187	FALSTAFF	I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
2023	11	3.2.188	FALSTAFF	liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
2024	11	3.2.189	FALSTAFF	shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
2025	11	3.2.190	FALSTAFF	forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
2026	11	3.2.191	FALSTAFF	am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
2027	11	3.2.192	FALSTAFF	church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
2028	11	3.2.193	FALSTAFF	spoil of me.
2029	12	3.2.194	BARDOLPH	Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
2030	13	3.2.195	FALSTAFF	Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
2031	13	3.2.196	FALSTAFF	me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
2032	13	3.2.197	FALSTAFF	need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
2033	13	3.2.198	FALSTAFF	above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
2034	13	3.2.199	FALSTAFF	in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
2035	13	3.2.200	FALSTAFF	borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
2036	13	3.2.201	FALSTAFF	good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
2037	13	3.2.202	FALSTAFF	of all compass.
2038	14	3.2.203	BARDOLPH	Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
2039	14	3.2.204	BARDOLPH	be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
2040	14	3.2.205	BARDOLPH	compass, Sir John.
2041	15	3.2.206	FALSTAFF	Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
2042	15	3.2.207	FALSTAFF	thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
2043	15	3.2.208	FALSTAFF	the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
2044	15	3.2.209	FALSTAFF	Knight of the Burning Lamp.
2045	16	3.2.210	BARDOLPH	Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
2046	17	3.2.211	FALSTAFF	No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
2047	17	3.2.212	FALSTAFF	a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
2048	17	3.2.213	FALSTAFF	never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
2049	17	3.2.214	FALSTAFF	Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
2050	17	3.2.215	FALSTAFF	robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
2051	17	3.2.216	FALSTAFF	given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
2052	17	3.2.217	FALSTAFF	should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
2053	17	3.2.218	FALSTAFF	thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
2054	17	3.2.219	FALSTAFF	for the light in thy face, the son of utter
2055	17	3.2.220	FALSTAFF	darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
2056	17	3.2.221	FALSTAFF	night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
2057	17	3.2.222	FALSTAFF	hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
2058	17	3.2.223	FALSTAFF	there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
2059	17	3.2.224	FALSTAFF	perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
2060	17	3.2.225	FALSTAFF	Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
2061	17	3.2.226	FALSTAFF	torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
2062	17	3.2.227	FALSTAFF	tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
2063	17	3.2.228	FALSTAFF	drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
2064	17	3.2.229	FALSTAFF	at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
2065	17	3.2.230	FALSTAFF	maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
2066	17	3.2.231	FALSTAFF	time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
2067	17	3.2.232	FALSTAFF	it!
2068	18	3.2.233	BARDOLPH	'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
2069	19	3.2.234	FALSTAFF	God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
2070	19		FALSTAFF	Enter Hostess
2071	19	3.2.235	FALSTAFF	How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
2072	19	3.2.236	FALSTAFF	yet who picked my pocket?
2073	20	3.2.237	Hostess	Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
2074	20	3.2.238	Hostess	think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
2075	20	3.2.239	Hostess	I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
2076	20	3.2.240	Hostess	by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
2077	20	3.2.241	Hostess	was never lost in my house before.
2078	21	3.2.242	FALSTAFF	Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
2079	21	3.2.243	FALSTAFF	a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
2080	21	3.2.244	FALSTAFF	to, you are a woman, go.
2081	22	3.2.245	Hostess	Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
2082	22	3.2.246	Hostess	called so in mine own house before.
2083	23	3.2.247	FALSTAFF	Go to, I know you well enough.
2084	24	3.2.248	Hostess	No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
2085	24	3.2.249	Hostess	you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
2086	24	3.2.250	Hostess	you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
2087	24	3.2.251	Hostess	you a dozen of shirts to your back.
2088	25	3.2.252	FALSTAFF	Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
2089	25	3.2.253	FALSTAFF	bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.
2090	26	3.2.254	Hostess	Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
2091	26	3.2.255	Hostess	shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
2092	26	3.2.256	Hostess	John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
2093	26	3.2.257	Hostess	you, four and twenty pound.
2094	27	3.2.258	FALSTAFF	He had his part of it; let him pay.
2095	28	3.2.259	Hostess	He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
2096	29	3.2.260	FALSTAFF	How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
2097	29	3.2.261	FALSTAFF	let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
2098	29	3.2.262	FALSTAFF	Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
2099	29	3.2.263	FALSTAFF	of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
2100	29	3.2.264	FALSTAFF	shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
2101	29	3.2.265	FALSTAFF	seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
2102	30	3.2.266	Hostess	O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
2103	30	3.2.267	Hostess	how oft, that ring was copper!
2104	31	3.2.268	FALSTAFF	How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
2105	31	3.2.269	FALSTAFF	he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
2106	31	3.2.270	FALSTAFF	would say so.
2107	31		FALSTAFF	Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life
2108	31	3.2.271	FALSTAFF	How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
2109	31	3.2.272	FALSTAFF	must we all march?
2110	32	3.2.273	BARDOLPH	Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
2111	33	3.2.274	Hostess	My lord, I pray you, hear me.
2112	34	3.2.275	PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
2113	34	3.2.276	PRINCE HENRY	husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.
2114	35	3.2.277	Hostess	Good my lord, hear me.
2115	36	3.2.278	FALSTAFF	Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
2116	37	3.2.279	PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou, Jack?
2117	38	3.2.280	FALSTAFF	The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
2118	38	3.2.281	FALSTAFF	and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
2119	38	3.2.282	FALSTAFF	bawdy-house; they pick pockets.
2120	39	3.2.283	PRINCE HENRY	What didst thou lose, Jack?
2121	40	3.2.284	FALSTAFF	Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
2122	40	3.2.285	FALSTAFF	forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
2123	40	3.2.286	FALSTAFF	grandfather's.
2124	41	3.2.287	PRINCE HENRY	A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
2125	42	3.2.288	Hostess	So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
2126	42	3.2.289	Hostess	grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
2127	42	3.2.290	Hostess	of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
2128	42	3.2.291	Hostess	he would cudgel you.
2129	43	3.2.292	PRINCE HENRY	What! he did not?
2130	44	3.2.293	Hostess	There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
2131	45	3.2.294	FALSTAFF	There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
2132	45	3.2.295	FALSTAFF	prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
2133	45	3.2.296	FALSTAFF	fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
2134	45	3.2.297	FALSTAFF	deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
2135	45	3.2.298	FALSTAFF	go
2136	46	3.2.299	Hostess	Say, what thing? what thing?
2137	47	3.2.300	FALSTAFF	What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.
2138	48	3.2.301	Hostess	I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
2139	48	3.2.302	Hostess	shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,
2140	48	3.2.303	Hostess	setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
2141	48	3.2.304	Hostess	call me so.
2142	49	3.2.305	FALSTAFF	Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
2143	49	3.2.306	FALSTAFF	otherwise.
2144	50	3.2.307	Hostess	Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
2145	51	3.2.308	FALSTAFF	What beast! why, an otter.
2146	52	3.2.309	PRINCE HENRY	An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?
2147	53	3.2.310	FALSTAFF	Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
2148	53	3.2.311	FALSTAFF	where to have her.
2149	54	3.2.312	Hostess	Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
2150	54	3.2.313	Hostess	man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!
2151	55	3.2.314	PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.
2152	56	3.2.315	Hostess	So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you
2153	56	3.2.316	Hostess	ought him a thousand pound.
2154	57	3.2.317	PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
2155	58	3.2.318	FALSTAFF	A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
2156	58	3.2.319	FALSTAFF	a million: thou owest me thy love.
2157	59	3.2.320	Hostess	Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
2158	59	3.2.321	Hostess	cudgel you.
2159	60	3.2.322	FALSTAFF	Did I, Bardolph?
2160	61	3.2.323	BARDOLPH	Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
2161	62	3.2.324	FALSTAFF	Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
2162	63	3.2.325	PRINCE HENRY	I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
2163	64	3.2.326	FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
2164	64	3.2.327	FALSTAFF	but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
2165	64	3.2.328	FALSTAFF	roaring of a lion's whelp.
2166	65	3.2.329	PRINCE HENRY	And why not as the lion?
2167	66	3.2.330	FALSTAFF	The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
2168	66	3.2.331	FALSTAFF	think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
2169	66	3.2.332	FALSTAFF	I do, I pray God my girdle break.
2170	67	3.2.333	PRINCE HENRY	O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
2171	67	3.2.334	PRINCE HENRY	knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
2172	67	3.2.335	PRINCE HENRY	truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
2173	67	3.2.336	PRINCE HENRY	filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
2174	67	3.2.337	PRINCE HENRY	woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
2175	67	3.2.338	PRINCE HENRY	impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
2176	67	3.2.339	PRINCE HENRY	thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
2177	67	3.2.340	PRINCE HENRY	bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
2178	67	3.2.341	PRINCE HENRY	sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
2179	67	3.2.342	PRINCE HENRY	were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
2180	67	3.2.343	PRINCE HENRY	am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
2181	67	3.2.344	PRINCE HENRY	not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
2182	68	3.2.345	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
2183	68	3.2.346	FALSTAFF	innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
2184	68	3.2.347	FALSTAFF	Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
2185	68	3.2.348	FALSTAFF	have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
2186	68	3.2.349	FALSTAFF	frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?
2187	69	3.2.350	PRINCE HENRY	It appears so by the story.
2188	70	3.2.351	FALSTAFF	Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
2189	70	3.2.352	FALSTAFF	love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
2190	70	3.2.353	FALSTAFF	guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
2191	70	3.2.354	FALSTAFF	reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
2192	70	3.2.355	FALSTAFF	prithee, be gone.
2193	70		FALSTAFF	Exit Hostess
2194	70	3.2.356	FALSTAFF	Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
2195	70	3.2.357	FALSTAFF	lad, how is that answered?
2196	71	3.2.358	PRINCE HENRY	O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
2197	71	3.2.359	PRINCE HENRY	thee: the money is paid back again.
2198	72	3.2.360	FALSTAFF	O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.
2199	73	3.2.361	PRINCE HENRY	I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
2200	74	3.2.362	FALSTAFF	Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
2201	74	3.2.363	FALSTAFF	do it with unwashed hands too.
2202	75	3.2.364	BARDOLPH	Do, my lord.
2203	76	3.2.365	PRINCE HENRY	I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
2204	77	3.2.366	FALSTAFF	I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
2205	77	3.2.367	FALSTAFF	one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
2206	77	3.2.368	FALSTAFF	age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
2207	77	3.2.369	FALSTAFF	heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
2208	77	3.2.370	FALSTAFF	these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
2209	77	3.2.371	FALSTAFF	laud them, I praise them.
2210	78	3.2.372	PRINCE HENRY	Bardolph!
2211	79	3.2.373	BARDOLPH	My lord?
2212	80	3.2.374	PRINCE HENRY	Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
2213	80	3.2.375	PRINCE HENRY	brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
2214	80		PRINCE HENRY	Exit Bardolph
2215	80	3.2.376	PRINCE HENRY	Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have
2216	80	3.2.377	PRINCE HENRY	thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
2217	80		PRINCE HENRY	Exit Peto
2218	80	3.2.378	PRINCE HENRY	Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
2219	80	3.2.379	PRINCE HENRY	o'clock in the afternoon.
2220	80	3.2.380	PRINCE HENRY	There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
2221	80	3.2.381	PRINCE HENRY	Money and order for their furniture.
2222	80	3.2.382	PRINCE HENRY	The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
2223	80	3.2.383	PRINCE HENRY	And either we or they must lower lie.
2224	80		PRINCE HENRY	Exit PRINCE HENRY
2225	81	3.2.384	FALSTAFF	Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
2226	81	3.2.385	FALSTAFF	O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
2227	81		FALSTAFF	Exit
2228	81		FALSTAFF	ACT IV
2229	81		FALSTAFF	SCENE I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2230	81		FALSTAFF	Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS
2231	1	4.1.1	HOTSPUR	Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
2232	1	4.1.2	HOTSPUR	In this fine age were not thought flattery,
2233	1	4.1.3	HOTSPUR	Such attribution should the Douglas have,
2234	1	4.1.4	HOTSPUR	As not a soldier of this season's stamp
2235	1	4.1.5	HOTSPUR	Should go so general current through the world.
2236	1	4.1.6	HOTSPUR	By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy
2237	1	4.1.7	HOTSPUR	The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
2238	1	4.1.8	HOTSPUR	In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
2239	1	4.1.9	HOTSPUR	Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
2240	2	4.1.10	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Thou art the king of honour:
2241	2	4.1.11	EARL OF DOUGLAS	No man so potent breathes upon the ground
2242	2	4.1.12	EARL OF DOUGLAS	But I will beard him.
2243	3	4.1.13	HOTSPUR	Do so, and 'tis well.
2244	3		HOTSPUR	Enter a Messenger with letters
2245	3	4.1.14	HOTSPUR	What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
2246	4	4.1.15	Messenger	These letters come from your father.
2247	5	4.1.16	HOTSPUR	Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
2248	6	4.1.17	Messenger	He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
2249	7	4.1.18	HOTSPUR	'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
2250	7	4.1.19	HOTSPUR	In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
2251	7	4.1.20	HOTSPUR	Under whose government come they along?
2252	8	4.1.21	Messenger	His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
2253	9	4.1.22	EARL OF WORCESTER	I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
2254	10	4.1.23	Messenger	He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
2255	10	4.1.24	Messenger	And at the time of my departure thence
2256	10	4.1.25	Messenger	He was much fear'd by his physicians.
2257	11	4.1.26	EARL OF WORCESTER	I would the state of time had first been whole
2258	11	4.1.27	EARL OF WORCESTER	Ere he by sickness had been visited:
2259	11	4.1.28	EARL OF WORCESTER	His health was never better worth than now.
2260	12	4.1.29	HOTSPUR	Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
2261	12	4.1.30	HOTSPUR	The very life-blood of our enterprise;
2262	12	4.1.31	HOTSPUR	'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
2263	12	4.1.32	HOTSPUR	He writes me here, that inward sickness--
2264	12	4.1.33	HOTSPUR	And that his friends by deputation could not
2265	12	4.1.34	HOTSPUR	So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
2266	12	4.1.35	HOTSPUR	To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
2267	12	4.1.36	HOTSPUR	On any soul removed but on his own.
2268	12	4.1.37	HOTSPUR	Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
2269	12	4.1.38	HOTSPUR	That with our small conjunction we should on,
2270	12	4.1.39	HOTSPUR	To see how fortune is disposed to us;
2271	12	4.1.40	HOTSPUR	For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.
2272	12	4.1.41	HOTSPUR	Because the king is certainly possess'd
2273	12	4.1.42	HOTSPUR	Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
2274	13	4.1.43	EARL OF WORCESTER	Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
2275	14	4.1.44	HOTSPUR	A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
2276	14	4.1.45	HOTSPUR	And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want
2277	14	4.1.46	HOTSPUR	Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
2278	14	4.1.47	HOTSPUR	To set the exact wealth of all our states
2279	14	4.1.48	HOTSPUR	All at one cast? to set so rich a main
2280	14	4.1.49	HOTSPUR	On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
2281	14	4.1.50	HOTSPUR	It were not good; for therein should we read
2282	14	4.1.51	HOTSPUR	The very bottom and the soul of hope,
2283	14	4.1.52	HOTSPUR	The very list, the very utmost bound
2284	14	4.1.53	HOTSPUR	Of all our fortunes.
2285	15	4.1.54	EARL OF DOUGLAS	'Faith, and so we should;
2286	15	4.1.55	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Where now remains a sweet reversion:
2287	15	4.1.56	EARL OF DOUGLAS	We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
2288	15	4.1.57	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Is to come in:
2289	15	4.1.58	EARL OF DOUGLAS	A comfort of retirement lives in this.
2290	16	4.1.59	HOTSPUR	A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
2291	16	4.1.60	HOTSPUR	If that the devil and mischance look big
2292	16	4.1.61	HOTSPUR	Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
2293	17	4.1.62	EARL OF WORCESTER	But yet I would your father had been here.
2294	17	4.1.63	EARL OF WORCESTER	The quality and hair of our attempt
2295	17	4.1.64	EARL OF WORCESTER	Brooks no division: it will be thought
2296	17	4.1.65	EARL OF WORCESTER	By some, that know not why he is away,
2297	17	4.1.66	EARL OF WORCESTER	That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
2298	17	4.1.67	EARL OF WORCESTER	Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
2299	17	4.1.68	EARL OF WORCESTER	And think how such an apprehension
2300	17	4.1.69	EARL OF WORCESTER	May turn the tide of fearful faction
2301	17	4.1.70	EARL OF WORCESTER	And breed a kind of question in our cause;
2302	17	4.1.71	EARL OF WORCESTER	For well you know we of the offering side
2303	17	4.1.72	EARL OF WORCESTER	Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
2304	17	4.1.73	EARL OF WORCESTER	And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
2305	17	4.1.74	EARL OF WORCESTER	The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
2306	17	4.1.75	EARL OF WORCESTER	This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
2307	17	4.1.76	EARL OF WORCESTER	That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
2308	17	4.1.77	EARL OF WORCESTER	Before not dreamt of.
2309	18	4.1.78	HOTSPUR	You strain too far.
2310	18	4.1.79	HOTSPUR	I rather of his absence make this use:
2311	18	4.1.80	HOTSPUR	It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
2312	18	4.1.81	HOTSPUR	A larger dare to our great enterprise,
2313	18	4.1.82	HOTSPUR	Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
2314	18	4.1.83	HOTSPUR	If we without his help can make a head
2315	18	4.1.84	HOTSPUR	To push against a kingdom, with his help
2316	18	4.1.85	HOTSPUR	We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
2317	18	4.1.86	HOTSPUR	Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.
2318	19	4.1.87	EARL OF DOUGLAS	As heart can think: there is not such a word
2319	19	4.1.88	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
2320	19		EARL OF DOUGLAS	Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
2321	20	4.1.89	HOTSPUR	My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
2322	21	4.1.90	VERNON	Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
2323	21	4.1.91	VERNON	The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
2324	21	4.1.92	VERNON	Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.
2325	22	4.1.93	HOTSPUR	No harm: what more?
2326	23	4.1.94	VERNON	And further, I have learn'd,
2327	23	4.1.95	VERNON	The king himself in person is set forth,
2328	23	4.1.96	VERNON	Or hitherwards intended speedily,
2329	23	4.1.97	VERNON	With strong and mighty preparation.
2330	24	4.1.98	HOTSPUR	He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
2331	24	4.1.99	HOTSPUR	The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
2332	24	4.1.100	HOTSPUR	And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
2333	24	4.1.101	HOTSPUR	And bid it pass?
2334	25	4.1.102	VERNON	All furnish'd, all in arms;
2335	25	4.1.103	VERNON	All plumed like estridges that with the wind
2336	25	4.1.104	VERNON	Baited like eagles having lately bathed;
2337	25	4.1.105	VERNON	Glittering in golden coats, like images;
2338	25	4.1.106	VERNON	As full of spirit as the month of May,
2339	25	4.1.107	VERNON	And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
2340	25	4.1.108	VERNON	Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
2341	25	4.1.109	VERNON	I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
2342	25	4.1.110	VERNON	His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd
2343	25	4.1.111	VERNON	Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
2344	25	4.1.112	VERNON	And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
2345	25	4.1.113	VERNON	As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
2346	25	4.1.114	VERNON	To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
2347	25	4.1.115	VERNON	And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
2348	26	4.1.116	HOTSPUR	No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
2349	26	4.1.117	HOTSPUR	This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
2350	26	4.1.118	HOTSPUR	They come like sacrifices in their trim,
2351	26	4.1.119	HOTSPUR	And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
2352	26	4.1.120	HOTSPUR	All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
2353	26	4.1.121	HOTSPUR	The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
2354	26	4.1.122	HOTSPUR	Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
2355	26	4.1.123	HOTSPUR	To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
2356	26	4.1.124	HOTSPUR	And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
2357	26	4.1.125	HOTSPUR	Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
2358	26	4.1.126	HOTSPUR	Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
2359	26	4.1.127	HOTSPUR	Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
2360	26	4.1.128	HOTSPUR	Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
2361	26	4.1.129	HOTSPUR	O that Glendower were come!
2362	27	4.1.130	VERNON	There is more news:
2363	27	4.1.131	VERNON	I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
2364	27	4.1.132	VERNON	He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
2365	28	4.1.133	EARL OF DOUGLAS	That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
2366	29	4.1.134	WORCESTER	Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
2367	30	4.1.135	HOTSPUR	What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
2368	31	4.1.136	VERNON	To thirty thousand.
2369	32	4.1.137	HOTSPUR	Forty let it be:
2370	32	4.1.138	HOTSPUR	My father and Glendower being both away,
2371	32	4.1.139	HOTSPUR	The powers of us may serve so great a day
2372	32	4.1.140	HOTSPUR	Come, let us take a muster speedily:
2373	32	4.1.141	HOTSPUR	Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
2374	33	4.1.142	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
2375	33	4.1.143	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
2376	33		EARL OF DOUGLAS	Exeunt
2377	33		EARL OF DOUGLAS	SCENE II. A public road near Coventry.
2378	33		EARL OF DOUGLAS	Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
2379	1	4.2.1	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
2380	1	4.2.2	FALSTAFF	bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
2381	1	4.2.3	FALSTAFF	we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
2382	2	4.2.4	BARDOLPH	Will you give me money, captain?
2383	3	4.2.5	FALSTAFF	Lay out, lay out.
2384	4	4.2.6	BARDOLPH	This bottle makes an angel.
2385	5	4.2.7	FALSTAFF	An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
2386	5	4.2.8	FALSTAFF	twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
2387	5	4.2.9	FALSTAFF	my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
2388	6	4.2.10	BARDOLPH	I will, captain: farewell.
2389	6		BARDOLPH	Exit
2390	7	4.2.11	FALSTAFF	If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
2391	7	4.2.12	FALSTAFF	gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
2392	7	4.2.13	FALSTAFF	I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
2393	7	4.2.14	FALSTAFF	soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
2394	7	4.2.15	FALSTAFF	none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
2395	7	4.2.16	FALSTAFF	me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
2396	7	4.2.17	FALSTAFF	twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
2397	7	4.2.18	FALSTAFF	as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
2398	7	4.2.19	FALSTAFF	fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
2399	7	4.2.20	FALSTAFF	fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
2400	7	4.2.21	FALSTAFF	toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
2401	7	4.2.22	FALSTAFF	bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
2402	7	4.2.23	FALSTAFF	their services; and now my whole charge consists of
2403	7	4.2.24	FALSTAFF	ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
2404	7	4.2.25	FALSTAFF	companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
2405	7	4.2.26	FALSTAFF	painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
2406	7	4.2.27	FALSTAFF	sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
2407	7	4.2.28	FALSTAFF	discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
2408	7	4.2.29	FALSTAFF	younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
2409	7	4.2.30	FALSTAFF	trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
2410	7	4.2.31	FALSTAFF	long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
2411	7	4.2.32	FALSTAFF	an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
2412	7	4.2.33	FALSTAFF	the rooms of them that have bought out their
2413	7	4.2.34	FALSTAFF	services, that you would think that I had a hundred
2414	7	4.2.35	FALSTAFF	and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
2415	7	4.2.36	FALSTAFF	swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
2416	7	4.2.37	FALSTAFF	fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
2417	7	4.2.38	FALSTAFF	all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
2418	7	4.2.39	FALSTAFF	hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
2419	7	4.2.40	FALSTAFF	Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
2420	7	4.2.41	FALSTAFF	villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
2421	7	4.2.42	FALSTAFF	gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
2422	7	4.2.43	FALSTAFF	prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
2423	7	4.2.44	FALSTAFF	company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
2424	7	4.2.45	FALSTAFF	together and thrown over the shoulders like an
2425	7	4.2.46	FALSTAFF	herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
2426	7	4.2.47	FALSTAFF	the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
2427	7	4.2.48	FALSTAFF	the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
2428	7	4.2.49	FALSTAFF	one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.
2429	7		FALSTAFF	Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
2430	8	4.2.50	PRINCE HENRY	How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!
2431	9	4.2.51	FALSTAFF	What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
2432	9	4.2.52	FALSTAFF	in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
2433	9	4.2.53	FALSTAFF	cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
2434	9	4.2.54	FALSTAFF	at Shrewsbury.
2435	10	4.2.55	WESTMORELAND	Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
2436	10	4.2.56	WESTMORELAND	there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
2437	10	4.2.57	WESTMORELAND	The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
2438	10	4.2.58	WESTMORELAND	away all night.
2439	11	4.2.59	FALSTAFF	Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
2440	11	4.2.60	FALSTAFF	steal cream.
2441	12	4.2.61	PRINCE HENRY	I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
2442	12	4.2.62	PRINCE HENRY	already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
2443	12	4.2.63	PRINCE HENRY	fellows are these that come after?
2444	13	4.2.64	FALSTAFF	Mine, Hal, mine.
2445	14	4.2.65	PRINCE HENRY	I did never see such pitiful rascals.
2446	15	4.2.66	FALSTAFF	Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
2447	15	4.2.67	FALSTAFF	for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
2448	15	4.2.68	FALSTAFF	tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
2449	16	4.2.69	WESTMORELAND	Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
2450	16	4.2.70	WESTMORELAND	and bare, too beggarly.
2451	17	4.2.71	FALSTAFF	'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
2452	17	4.2.72	FALSTAFF	that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
2453	17	4.2.73	FALSTAFF	learned that of me.
2454	18	4.2.74	PRINCE HENRY	No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
2455	18	4.2.75	PRINCE HENRY	the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
2456	18	4.2.76	PRINCE HENRY	already in the field.
2457	19	4.2.77	FALSTAFF	What, is the king encamped?
2458	20	4.2.78	WESTMORELAND	He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
2459	21	4.2.79	FALSTAFF	Well,
2460	21	4.2.80	FALSTAFF	To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
2461	21	4.2.81	FALSTAFF	Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
2462	21		FALSTAFF	Exeunt
2463	21		FALSTAFF	SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2464	21		FALSTAFF	Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON
2465	1	4.3.1	HOTSPUR	We'll fight with him to-night.
2466	2	4.3.2	EARL OF WORCESTER	It may not be.
2467	3	4.3.3	EARL OF DOUGLAS	You give him then the advantage.
2468	4	4.3.4	VERNON	Not a whit.
2469	5	4.3.5	HOTSPUR	Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
2470	6	4.3.6	VERNON	So do we.
2471	7	4.3.7	HOTSPUR	His is certain, ours is doubtful.
2472	8	4.3.8	EARL OF WORCESTER	Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
2473	9	4.3.9	VERNON	Do not, my lord.
2474	10	4.3.10	EARL OF DOUGLAS	You do not counsel well:
2475	10	4.3.11	EARL OF DOUGLAS	You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
2476	11	4.3.12	VERNON	Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
2477	11	4.3.13	VERNON	And I dare well maintain it with my life,
2478	11	4.3.14	VERNON	If well-respected honour bid me on,
2479	11	4.3.15	VERNON	I hold as little counsel with weak fear
2480	11	4.3.16	VERNON	As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:
2481	11	4.3.17	VERNON	Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
2482	11	4.3.18	VERNON	Which of us fears.
2483	12	4.3.19	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Yea, or to-night.
2484	13	4.3.20	VERNON	Content.
2485	14	4.3.21	HOTSPUR	To-night, say I.
2486	15	4.3.22	VERNON	Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
2487	15	4.3.23	VERNON	Being men of such great leading as you are,
2488	15	4.3.24	VERNON	That you foresee not what impediments
2489	15	4.3.25	VERNON	Drag back our expedition: certain horse
2490	15	4.3.26	VERNON	Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
2491	15	4.3.27	VERNON	Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
2492	15	4.3.28	VERNON	And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
2493	15	4.3.29	VERNON	Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
2494	15	4.3.30	VERNON	That not a horse is half the half of himself.
2495	16	4.3.31	HOTSPUR	So are the horses of the enemy
2496	16	4.3.32	HOTSPUR	In general, journey-bated and brought low:
2497	16	4.3.33	HOTSPUR	The better part of ours are full of rest.
2498	17	4.3.34	EARL OF WORCESTER	The number of the king exceedeth ours:
2499	17	4.3.35	EARL OF WORCESTER	For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.
2500	17		EARL OF WORCESTER	The trumpet sounds a parley
2501	17		EARL OF WORCESTER	Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT
2502	18	4.3.36	SIR WALTER BLUNT	I come with gracious offers from the king,
2503	18	4.3.37	SIR WALTER BLUNT	if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
2504	19	4.3.38	HOTSPUR	Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
2505	19	4.3.39	HOTSPUR	You were of our determination!
2506	19	4.3.40	HOTSPUR	Some of us love you well; and even those some
2507	19	4.3.41	HOTSPUR	Envy your great deservings and good name,
2508	19	4.3.42	HOTSPUR	Because you are not of our quality,
2509	19	4.3.43	HOTSPUR	But stand against us like an enemy.
2510	20	4.3.44	SIR WALTER BLUNT	And God defend but still I should stand so,
2511	20	4.3.45	SIR WALTER BLUNT	So long as out of limit and true rule
2512	20	4.3.46	SIR WALTER BLUNT	You stand against anointed majesty.
2513	20	4.3.47	SIR WALTER BLUNT	But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
2514	20	4.3.48	SIR WALTER BLUNT	The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
2515	20	4.3.49	SIR WALTER BLUNT	You conjure from the breast of civil peace
2516	20	4.3.50	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
2517	20	4.3.51	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Audacious cruelty. If that the king
2518	20	4.3.52	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Have any way your good deserts forgot,
2519	20	4.3.53	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Which he confesseth to be manifold,
2520	20	4.3.54	SIR WALTER BLUNT	He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
2521	20	4.3.55	SIR WALTER BLUNT	You shall have your desires with interest
2522	20	4.3.56	SIR WALTER BLUNT	And pardon absolute for yourself and these
2523	20	4.3.57	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Herein misled by your suggestion.
2524	21	4.3.58	HOTSPUR	The king is kind; and well we know the king
2525	21	4.3.59	HOTSPUR	Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
2526	21	4.3.60	HOTSPUR	My father and my uncle and myself
2527	21	4.3.61	HOTSPUR	Did give him that same royalty he wears;
2528	21	4.3.62	HOTSPUR	And when he was not six and twenty strong,
2529	21	4.3.63	HOTSPUR	Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
2530	21	4.3.64	HOTSPUR	A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
2531	21	4.3.65	HOTSPUR	My father gave him welcome to the shore;
2532	21	4.3.66	HOTSPUR	And when he heard him swear and vow to God
2533	21	4.3.67	HOTSPUR	He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
2534	21	4.3.68	HOTSPUR	To sue his livery and beg his peace,
2535	21	4.3.69	HOTSPUR	With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
2536	21	4.3.70	HOTSPUR	My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
2537	21	4.3.71	HOTSPUR	Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
2538	21	4.3.72	HOTSPUR	Now when the lords and barons of the realm
2539	21	4.3.73	HOTSPUR	Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
2540	21	4.3.74	HOTSPUR	The more and less came in with cap and knee;
2541	21	4.3.75	HOTSPUR	Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
2542	21	4.3.76	HOTSPUR	Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
2543	21	4.3.77	HOTSPUR	Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
2544	21	4.3.78	HOTSPUR	Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
2545	21	4.3.79	HOTSPUR	Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
2546	21	4.3.80	HOTSPUR	He presently, as greatness knows itself,
2547	21	4.3.81	HOTSPUR	Steps me a little higher than his vow
2548	21	4.3.82	HOTSPUR	Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
2549	21	4.3.83	HOTSPUR	Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
2550	21	4.3.84	HOTSPUR	And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
2551	21	4.3.85	HOTSPUR	Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
2552	21	4.3.86	HOTSPUR	That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
2553	21	4.3.87	HOTSPUR	Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
2554	21	4.3.88	HOTSPUR	Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
2555	21	4.3.89	HOTSPUR	This seeming brow of justice, did he win
2556	21	4.3.90	HOTSPUR	The hearts of all that he did angle for;
2557	21	4.3.91	HOTSPUR	Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
2558	21	4.3.92	HOTSPUR	Of all the favourites that the absent king
2559	21	4.3.93	HOTSPUR	In deputation left behind him here,
2560	21	4.3.94	HOTSPUR	When he was personal in the Irish war.
2561	22	4.3.95	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Tut, I came not to hear this.
2562	23	4.3.96	HOTSPUR	Then to the point.
2563	23	4.3.97	HOTSPUR	In short time after, he deposed the king;
2564	23	4.3.98	HOTSPUR	Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
2565	23	4.3.99	HOTSPUR	And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:
2566	23	4.3.100	HOTSPUR	To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
2567	23	4.3.101	HOTSPUR	Who is, if every owner were well placed,
2568	23	4.3.102	HOTSPUR	Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
2569	23	4.3.103	HOTSPUR	There without ransom to lie forfeited;
2570	23	4.3.104	HOTSPUR	Disgraced me in my happy victories,
2571	23	4.3.105	HOTSPUR	Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
2572	23	4.3.106	HOTSPUR	Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
2573	23	4.3.107	HOTSPUR	In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
2574	23	4.3.108	HOTSPUR	Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
2575	23	4.3.109	HOTSPUR	And in conclusion drove us to seek out
2576	23	4.3.110	HOTSPUR	This head of safety; and withal to pry
2577	23	4.3.111	HOTSPUR	Into his title, the which we find
2578	23	4.3.112	HOTSPUR	Too indirect for long continuance.
2579	24	4.3.113	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Shall I return this answer to the king?
2580	25	4.3.114	HOTSPUR	Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
2581	25	4.3.115	HOTSPUR	Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
2582	25	4.3.116	HOTSPUR	Some surety for a safe return again,
2583	25	4.3.117	HOTSPUR	And in the morning early shall my uncle
2584	25	4.3.118	HOTSPUR	Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
2585	26	4.3.119	SIR WALTER BLUNT	I would you would accept of grace and love.
2586	27	4.3.120	HOTSPUR	And may be so we shall.
2587	28	4.3.121	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Pray God you do.
2588	28		SIR WALTER BLUNT	Exeunt
2589	28		SIR WALTER BLUNT	SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.
2590	28		SIR WALTER BLUNT	Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
2591	1	4.4.1	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
2592	1	4.4.2	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	With winged haste to the lord marshal;
2593	1	4.4.3	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
2594	1	4.4.4	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	To whom they are directed. If you knew
2595	1	4.4.5	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	How much they do to import, you would make haste.
2596	2	4.4.6	SIR MICHAEL	My good lord,
2597	2	4.4.7	SIR MICHAEL	I guess their tenor.
2598	3	4.4.8	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Like enough you do.
2599	3	4.4.9	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
2600	3	4.4.10	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
2601	3	4.4.11	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
2602	3	4.4.12	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	As I am truly given to understand,
2603	3	4.4.13	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	The king with mighty and quick-raised power
2604	3	4.4.14	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
2605	3	4.4.15	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	What with the sickness of Northumberland,
2606	3	4.4.16	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Whose power was in the first proportion,
2607	3	4.4.17	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
2608	3	4.4.18	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Who with them was a rated sinew too
2609	3	4.4.19	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
2610	3	4.4.20	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I fear the power of Percy is too weak
2611	3	4.4.21	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	To wage an instant trial with the king.
2612	4	4.4.22	SIR MICHAEL	Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
2613	4	4.4.23	SIR MICHAEL	There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
2614	5	4.4.24	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	No, Mortimer is not there.
2615	6	4.4.25	SIR MICHAEL	But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
2616	6	4.4.26	SIR MICHAEL	And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
2617	6	4.4.27	SIR MICHAEL	Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
2618	7	4.4.28	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
2619	7	4.4.29	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	The special head of all the land together:
2620	7	4.4.30	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
2621	7	4.4.31	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
2622	7	4.4.32	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And moe corrivals and dear men
2623	7	4.4.33	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Of estimation and command in arms.
2624	8	4.4.34	SIR MICHAEL	Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
2625	9	4.4.35	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
2626	9	4.4.36	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
2627	9	4.4.37	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
2628	9	4.4.38	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
2629	9	4.4.39	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	For he hath heard of our confederacy,
2630	9	4.4.40	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
2631	9	4.4.41	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Therefore make haste. I must go write again
2632	9	4.4.42	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.
2633	9		ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Exeunt
2634	9		ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	ACT V
2635	9		ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.
2636	9		ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF
2637	1	5.1.1	KING HENRY IV	How bloodily the sun begins to peer
2638	1	5.1.2	KING HENRY IV	Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
2639	1	5.1.3	KING HENRY IV	At his distemperature.
2640	2	5.1.4	PRINCE HENRY	The southern wind
2641	2	5.1.5	PRINCE HENRY	Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
2642	2	5.1.6	PRINCE HENRY	And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
2643	2	5.1.7	PRINCE HENRY	Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
2644	3	5.1.8	KING HENRY IV	Then with the losers let it sympathize,
2645	3	5.1.9	KING HENRY IV	For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
2646	3		KING HENRY IV	The trumpet sounds
2647	3		KING HENRY IV	Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
2648	3	5.1.10	KING HENRY IV	How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
2649	3	5.1.11	KING HENRY IV	That you and I should meet upon such terms
2650	3	5.1.12	KING HENRY IV	As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
2651	3	5.1.13	KING HENRY IV	And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
2652	3	5.1.14	KING HENRY IV	To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
2653	3	5.1.15	KING HENRY IV	This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
2654	3	5.1.16	KING HENRY IV	What say you to it? will you again unknit
2655	3	5.1.17	KING HENRY IV	This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
2656	3	5.1.18	KING HENRY IV	And move in that obedient orb again
2657	3	5.1.19	KING HENRY IV	Where you did give a fair and natural light,
2658	3	5.1.20	KING HENRY IV	And be no more an exhaled meteor,
2659	3	5.1.21	KING HENRY IV	A prodigy of fear and a portent
2660	3	5.1.22	KING HENRY IV	Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
2661	4	5.1.23	EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear me, my liege:
2662	4	5.1.24	EARL OF WORCESTER	For mine own part, I could be well content
2663	4	5.1.25	EARL OF WORCESTER	To entertain the lag-end of my life
2664	4	5.1.26	EARL OF WORCESTER	With quiet hours; for I do protest,
2665	4	5.1.27	EARL OF WORCESTER	I have not sought the day of this dislike.
2666	5	5.1.28	KING HENRY IV	You have not sought it! how comes it, then?
2667	6	5.1.29	FALSTAFF	Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
2668	7	5.1.30	PRINCE HENRY	Peace, chewet, peace!
2669	8	5.1.31	EARL OF WORCESTER	It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
2670	8	5.1.32	EARL OF WORCESTER	Of favour from myself and all our house;
2671	8	5.1.33	EARL OF WORCESTER	And yet I must remember you, my lord,
2672	8	5.1.34	EARL OF WORCESTER	We were the first and dearest of your friends.
2673	8	5.1.35	EARL OF WORCESTER	For you my staff of office did I break
2674	8	5.1.36	EARL OF WORCESTER	In Richard's time; and posted day and night
2675	8	5.1.37	EARL OF WORCESTER	to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
2676	8	5.1.38	EARL OF WORCESTER	When yet you were in place and in account
2677	8	5.1.39	EARL OF WORCESTER	Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
2678	8	5.1.40	EARL OF WORCESTER	It was myself, my brother and his son,
2679	8	5.1.41	EARL OF WORCESTER	That brought you home and boldly did outdare
2680	8	5.1.42	EARL OF WORCESTER	The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
2681	8	5.1.43	EARL OF WORCESTER	And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
2682	8	5.1.44	EARL OF WORCESTER	That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
2683	8	5.1.45	EARL OF WORCESTER	Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
2684	8	5.1.46	EARL OF WORCESTER	The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
2685	8	5.1.47	EARL OF WORCESTER	To this we swore our aid. But in short space
2686	8	5.1.48	EARL OF WORCESTER	It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
2687	8	5.1.49	EARL OF WORCESTER	And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
2688	8	5.1.50	EARL OF WORCESTER	What with our help, what with the absent king,
2689	8	5.1.51	EARL OF WORCESTER	What with the injuries of a wanton time,
2690	8	5.1.52	EARL OF WORCESTER	The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
2691	8	5.1.53	EARL OF WORCESTER	And the contrarious winds that held the king
2692	8	5.1.54	EARL OF WORCESTER	So long in his unlucky Irish wars
2693	8	5.1.55	EARL OF WORCESTER	That all in England did repute him dead:
2694	8	5.1.56	EARL OF WORCESTER	And from this swarm of fair advantages
2695	8	5.1.57	EARL OF WORCESTER	You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
2696	8	5.1.58	EARL OF WORCESTER	To gripe the general sway into your hand;
2697	8	5.1.59	EARL OF WORCESTER	Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
2698	8	5.1.60	EARL OF WORCESTER	And being fed by us you used us so
2699	8	5.1.61	EARL OF WORCESTER	As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
2700	8	5.1.62	EARL OF WORCESTER	Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
2701	8	5.1.63	EARL OF WORCESTER	Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
2702	8	5.1.64	EARL OF WORCESTER	That even our love durst not come near your sight
2703	8	5.1.65	EARL OF WORCESTER	For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
2704	8	5.1.66	EARL OF WORCESTER	We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
2705	8	5.1.67	EARL OF WORCESTER	Out of sight and raise this present head;
2706	8	5.1.68	EARL OF WORCESTER	Whereby we stand opposed by such means
2707	8	5.1.69	EARL OF WORCESTER	As you yourself have forged against yourself
2708	8	5.1.70	EARL OF WORCESTER	By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
2709	8	5.1.71	EARL OF WORCESTER	And violation of all faith and troth
2710	8	5.1.72	EARL OF WORCESTER	Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
2711	9	5.1.73	KING HENRY IV	These things indeed you have articulate,
2712	9	5.1.74	KING HENRY IV	Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
2713	9	5.1.75	KING HENRY IV	To face the garment of rebellion
2714	9	5.1.76	KING HENRY IV	With some fine colour that may please the eye
2715	9	5.1.77	KING HENRY IV	Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
2716	9	5.1.78	KING HENRY IV	Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
2717	9	5.1.79	KING HENRY IV	Of hurlyburly innovation:
2718	9	5.1.80	KING HENRY IV	And never yet did insurrection want
2719	9	5.1.81	KING HENRY IV	Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
2720	9	5.1.82	KING HENRY IV	Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
2721	9	5.1.83	KING HENRY IV	Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
2722	10	5.1.84	PRINCE HENRY	In both your armies there is many a soul
2723	10	5.1.85	PRINCE HENRY	Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
2724	10	5.1.86	PRINCE HENRY	If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
2725	10	5.1.87	PRINCE HENRY	The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
2726	10	5.1.88	PRINCE HENRY	In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
2727	10	5.1.89	PRINCE HENRY	This present enterprise set off his head,
2728	10	5.1.90	PRINCE HENRY	I do not think a braver gentleman,
2729	10	5.1.91	PRINCE HENRY	More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
2730	10	5.1.92	PRINCE HENRY	More daring or more bold, is now alive
2731	10	5.1.93	PRINCE HENRY	To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
2732	10	5.1.94	PRINCE HENRY	For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
2733	10	5.1.95	PRINCE HENRY	I have a truant been to chivalry;
2734	10	5.1.96	PRINCE HENRY	And so I hear he doth account me too;
2735	10	5.1.97	PRINCE HENRY	Yet this before my father's majesty--
2736	10	5.1.98	PRINCE HENRY	I am content that he shall take the odds
2737	10	5.1.99	PRINCE HENRY	Of his great name and estimation,
2738	10	5.1.100	PRINCE HENRY	And will, to save the blood on either side,
2739	10	5.1.101	PRINCE HENRY	Try fortune with him in a single fight.
2740	11	5.1.102	KING HENRY IV	And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
2741	11	5.1.103	KING HENRY IV	Albeit considerations infinite
2742	11	5.1.104	KING HENRY IV	Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
2743	11	5.1.105	KING HENRY IV	We love our people well; even those we love
2744	11	5.1.106	KING HENRY IV	That are misled upon your cousin's part;
2745	11	5.1.107	KING HENRY IV	And, will they take the offer of our grace,
2746	11	5.1.108	KING HENRY IV	Both he and they and you, every man
2747	11	5.1.109	KING HENRY IV	Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
2748	11	5.1.110	KING HENRY IV	So tell your cousin, and bring me word
2749	11	5.1.111	KING HENRY IV	What he will do: but if he will not yield,
2750	11	5.1.112	KING HENRY IV	Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
2751	11	5.1.113	KING HENRY IV	And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
2752	11	5.1.114	KING HENRY IV	We will not now be troubled with reply:
2753	11	5.1.115	KING HENRY IV	We offer fair; take it advisedly.
2754	11		KING HENRY IV	Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
2755	12	5.1.116	PRINCE HENRY	It will not be accepted, on my life:
2756	12	5.1.117	PRINCE HENRY	The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
2757	12	5.1.118	PRINCE HENRY	Are confident against the world in arms.
2758	13	5.1.119	KING HENRY IV	Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
2759	13	5.1.120	KING HENRY IV	For, on their answer, will we set on them:
2760	13	5.1.121	KING HENRY IV	And God befriend us, as our cause is just!
2761	13		KING HENRY IV	Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF
2762	14	5.1.122	FALSTAFF	Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
2763	14	5.1.123	FALSTAFF	me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.
2764	15	5.1.124	PRINCE HENRY	Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
2765	15	5.1.125	PRINCE HENRY	Say thy prayers, and farewell.
2766	16	5.1.126	FALSTAFF	I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.
2767	17	5.1.127	PRINCE HENRY	Why, thou owest God a death.
2768	17		PRINCE HENRY	Exit PRINCE HENRY
2769	18	5.1.128	FALSTAFF	'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
2770	18	5.1.129	FALSTAFF	his day. What need I be so forward with him that
2771	18	5.1.130	FALSTAFF	calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks
2772	18	5.1.131	FALSTAFF	me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
2773	18	5.1.132	FALSTAFF	come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
2774	18	5.1.133	FALSTAFF	an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
2775	18	5.1.134	FALSTAFF	Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
2776	18	5.1.135	FALSTAFF	honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
2777	18	5.1.136	FALSTAFF	is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
2778	18	5.1.137	FALSTAFF	he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
2779	18	5.1.138	FALSTAFF	Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
2780	18	5.1.139	FALSTAFF	to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
2781	18	5.1.140	FALSTAFF	no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
2782	18	5.1.141	FALSTAFF	I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
2783	18	5.1.142	FALSTAFF	ends my catechism.
2784	18		FALSTAFF	Exit
2785	18		FALSTAFF	SCENE II. The rebel camp.
2786	18		FALSTAFF	Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
2787	1	5.2.1	EARL OF WORCESTER	O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
2788	1	5.2.2	EARL OF WORCESTER	The liberal and kind offer of the king.
2789	2	5.2.3	VERNON	'Twere best he did.
2790	3	5.2.4	EARL OF WORCESTER	Then are we all undone.
2791	3	5.2.5	EARL OF WORCESTER	It is not possible, it cannot be,
2792	3	5.2.6	EARL OF WORCESTER	The king should keep his word in loving us;
2793	3	5.2.7	EARL OF WORCESTER	He will suspect us still and find a time
2794	3	5.2.8	EARL OF WORCESTER	To punish this offence in other faults:
2795	3	5.2.9	EARL OF WORCESTER	Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
2796	3	5.2.10	EARL OF WORCESTER	For treason is but trusted like the fox,
2797	3	5.2.11	EARL OF WORCESTER	Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,
2798	3	5.2.12	EARL OF WORCESTER	Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
2799	3	5.2.13	EARL OF WORCESTER	Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
2800	3	5.2.14	EARL OF WORCESTER	Interpretation will misquote our looks,
2801	3	5.2.15	EARL OF WORCESTER	And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
2802	3	5.2.16	EARL OF WORCESTER	The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
2803	3	5.2.17	EARL OF WORCESTER	My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
2804	3	5.2.18	EARL OF WORCESTER	it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
2805	3	5.2.19	EARL OF WORCESTER	And an adopted name of privilege,
2806	3	5.2.20	EARL OF WORCESTER	A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
2807	3	5.2.21	EARL OF WORCESTER	All his offences live upon my head
2808	3	5.2.22	EARL OF WORCESTER	And on his father's; we did train him on,
2809	3	5.2.23	EARL OF WORCESTER	And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
2810	3	5.2.24	EARL OF WORCESTER	We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
2811	3	5.2.25	EARL OF WORCESTER	Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
2812	3	5.2.26	EARL OF WORCESTER	In any case, the offer of the king.
2813	4	5.2.27	VERNON	Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
2814	4	5.2.28	VERNON	Here comes your cousin.
2815	4		VERNON	Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS
2816	5	5.2.29	HOTSPUR	My uncle is return'd:
2817	5	5.2.30	HOTSPUR	Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
2818	5	5.2.31	HOTSPUR	Uncle, what news?
2819	6	5.2.32	EARL OF WORCESTER	The king will bid you battle presently.
2820	7	5.2.33	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
2821	8	5.2.34	HOTSPUR	Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
2822	9	5.2.35	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
2823	9		EARL OF DOUGLAS	Exit
2824	10	5.2.36	EARL OF WORCESTER	There is no seeming mercy in the king.
2825	11	5.2.37	HOTSPUR	Did you beg any? God forbid!
2826	12	5.2.38	EARL OF WORCESTER	I told him gently of our grievances,
2827	12	5.2.39	EARL OF WORCESTER	Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
2828	12	5.2.40	EARL OF WORCESTER	By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
2829	12	5.2.41	EARL OF WORCESTER	He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
2830	12	5.2.42	EARL OF WORCESTER	With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
2831	12		EARL OF WORCESTER	Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS
2832	13	5.2.43	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
2833	13	5.2.44	EARL OF DOUGLAS	A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
2834	13	5.2.45	EARL OF DOUGLAS	And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
2835	13	5.2.46	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
2836	14	5.2.47	EARL OF WORCESTER	The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
2837	14	5.2.48	EARL OF WORCESTER	And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.
2838	15	5.2.49	HOTSPUR	O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
2839	15	5.2.50	HOTSPUR	And that no man might draw short breath today
2840	15	5.2.51	HOTSPUR	But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
2841	15	5.2.52	HOTSPUR	How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
2842	16	5.2.53	VERNON	No, by my soul; I never in my life
2843	16	5.2.54	VERNON	Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
2844	16	5.2.55	VERNON	Unless a brother should a brother dare
2845	16	5.2.56	VERNON	To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
2846	16	5.2.57	VERNON	He gave you all the duties of a man;
2847	16	5.2.58	VERNON	Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
2848	16	5.2.59	VERNON	Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
2849	16	5.2.60	VERNON	Making you ever better than his praise
2850	16	5.2.61	VERNON	By still dispraising praise valued in you;
2851	16	5.2.62	VERNON	And, which became him like a prince indeed,
2852	16	5.2.63	VERNON	He made a blushing cital of himself;
2853	16	5.2.64	VERNON	And chid his truant youth with such a grace
2854	16	5.2.65	VERNON	As if he master'd there a double spirit.
2855	16	5.2.66	VERNON	Of teaching and of learning instantly.
2856	16	5.2.67	VERNON	There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
2857	16	5.2.68	VERNON	If he outlive the envy of this day,
2858	16	5.2.69	VERNON	England did never owe so sweet a hope,
2859	16	5.2.70	VERNON	So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
2860	17	5.2.71	HOTSPUR	Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
2861	17	5.2.72	HOTSPUR	On his follies: never did I hear
2862	17	5.2.73	HOTSPUR	Of any prince so wild a libertine.
2863	17	5.2.74	HOTSPUR	But be he as he will, yet once ere night
2864	17	5.2.75	HOTSPUR	I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
2865	17	5.2.76	HOTSPUR	That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
2866	17	5.2.77	HOTSPUR	Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
2867	17	5.2.78	HOTSPUR	Better consider what you have to do
2868	17	5.2.79	HOTSPUR	Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
2869	17	5.2.80	HOTSPUR	Can lift your blood up with persuasion.
2870	17		HOTSPUR	Enter a Messenger
2871	18	5.2.81	Messenger	My lord, here are letters for you.
2872	19	5.2.82	HOTSPUR	I cannot read them now.
2873	19	5.2.83	HOTSPUR	O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
2874	19	5.2.84	HOTSPUR	To spend that shortness basely were too long,
2875	19	5.2.85	HOTSPUR	If life did ride upon a dial's point,
2876	19	5.2.86	HOTSPUR	Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
2877	19	5.2.87	HOTSPUR	An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
2878	19	5.2.88	HOTSPUR	If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
2879	19	5.2.89	HOTSPUR	Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
2880	19	5.2.90	HOTSPUR	When the intent of bearing them is just.
2881	19		HOTSPUR	Enter another Messenger
2882	20	5.2.91	Messenger	My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.
2883	21	5.2.92	HOTSPUR	I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
2884	21	5.2.93	HOTSPUR	For I profess not talking; only this--
2885	21	5.2.94	HOTSPUR	Let each man do his best: and here draw I
2886	21	5.2.95	HOTSPUR	A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
2887	21	5.2.96	HOTSPUR	With the best blood that I can meet withal
2888	21	5.2.97	HOTSPUR	In the adventure of this perilous day.
2889	21	5.2.98	HOTSPUR	Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
2890	21	5.2.99	HOTSPUR	Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
2891	21	5.2.100	HOTSPUR	And by that music let us all embrace;
2892	21	5.2.101	HOTSPUR	For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
2893	21	5.2.102	HOTSPUR	A second time do such a courtesy.
2894	21		HOTSPUR	The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt
2895	21		HOTSPUR	SCENE III. Plain between the camps.
2896	21		HOTSPUR	KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT
2897	1	5.3.1	SIR WALTER BLUNT	What is thy name, that in the battle thus
2898	1	5.3.2	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
2899	1	5.3.3	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Upon my head?
2900	2	5.3.4	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Know then, my name is Douglas;
2901	2	5.3.5	EARL OF DOUGLAS	And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
2902	2	5.3.6	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Because some tell me that thou art a king.
2903	3	5.3.7	SIR WALTER BLUNT	They tell thee true.
2904	4	5.3.8	EARL OF DOUGLAS	The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
2905	4	5.3.9	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
2906	4	5.3.10	EARL OF DOUGLAS	This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
2907	4	5.3.11	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
2908	5	5.3.12	SIR WALTER BLUNT	I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
2909	5	5.3.13	SIR WALTER BLUNT	And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
2910	5	5.3.14	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Lord Stafford's death.
2911	5		SIR WALTER BLUNT	They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR
2912	6	5.3.15	HOTSPUR	O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
2913	6	5.3.16	HOTSPUR	never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
2914	7	5.3.17	EARL OF DOUGLAS	All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.
2915	8	5.3.18	HOTSPUR	Where?
2916	9	5.3.19	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Here.
2917	10	5.3.20	HOTSPUR	This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:
2918	10	5.3.21	HOTSPUR	A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
2919	10	5.3.22	HOTSPUR	Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
2920	11	5.3.23	EARL OF DOUGLAS	A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
2921	11	5.3.24	EARL OF DOUGLAS	A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
2922	11	5.3.25	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
2923	12	5.3.26	HOTSPUR	The king hath many marching in his coats.
2924	13	5.3.27	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
2925	13	5.3.28	EARL OF DOUGLAS	I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
2926	13	5.3.29	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Until I meet the king.
2927	14	5.3.30	HOTSPUR	Up, and away!
2928	14	5.3.31	HOTSPUR	Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
2929	14		HOTSPUR	Exeunt
2930	14		HOTSPUR	Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF, solus
2931	15	5.3.32	FALSTAFF	Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear
2932	15	5.3.33	FALSTAFF	the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate.
2933	15	5.3.34	FALSTAFF	Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
2934	15	5.3.35	FALSTAFF	for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
2935	15	5.3.36	FALSTAFF	lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
2936	15	5.3.37	FALSTAFF	need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
2937	15	5.3.38	FALSTAFF	led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
2938	15	5.3.39	FALSTAFF	not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
2939	15	5.3.40	FALSTAFF	they are for the town's end, to beg during life.
2940	15	5.3.41	FALSTAFF	But who comes here?
2941	15		FALSTAFF	Enter PRINCE HENRY
2942	16	5.3.42	PRINCE HENRY	What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:
2943	16	5.3.43	PRINCE HENRY	Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
2944	16	5.3.44	PRINCE HENRY	Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
2945	16	5.3.45	PRINCE HENRY	Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,
2946	16	5.3.46	PRINCE HENRY	lend me thy sword.
2947	17	5.3.47	FALSTAFF	O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
2948	17	5.3.48	FALSTAFF	Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
2949	17	5.3.49	FALSTAFF	done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.
2950	18	5.3.50	PRINCE HENRY	He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,
2951	18	5.3.51	PRINCE HENRY	lend me thy sword.
2952	19	5.3.52	FALSTAFF	Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st
2953	19	5.3.53	FALSTAFF	not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.
2954	20	5.3.54	PRINCE HENRY	Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
2955	21	5.3.55	FALSTAFF	Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.
2956	21		FALSTAFF	PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack
2957	22	5.3.56	PRINCE HENRY	What, is it a time to jest and dally now?
2958	22		PRINCE HENRY	He throws the bottle at him. Exit
2959	23	5.3.57	FALSTAFF	Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
2960	23	5.3.58	FALSTAFF	come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
2961	23	5.3.59	FALSTAFF	willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
2962	23	5.3.60	FALSTAFF	not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
2963	23	5.3.61	FALSTAFF	life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes
2964	23	5.3.62	FALSTAFF	unlooked for, and there's an end.
2965	23		FALSTAFF	Exit FALSTAFF
2966	23		FALSTAFF	SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
2967	23		FALSTAFF	Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, and EARL OF WESTMORELAND
2968	1	5.4.1	KING HENRY IV	I prithee,
2969	1	5.4.2	KING HENRY IV	Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
2970	1	5.4.3	KING HENRY IV	Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
2971	2	5.4.4	LANCASTER	Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
2972	3	5.4.5	PRINCE HENRY	I beseech your majesty, make up,
2973	3	5.4.6	PRINCE HENRY	Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
2974	4	5.4.7	KING HENRY IV	I will do so.
2975	4	5.4.8	KING HENRY IV	My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
2976	5	5.4.9	WESTMORELAND	Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
2977	6	5.4.10	PRINCE HENRY	Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
2978	6	5.4.11	PRINCE HENRY	And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
2979	6	5.4.12	PRINCE HENRY	The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
2980	6	5.4.13	PRINCE HENRY	Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
2981	6	5.4.14	PRINCE HENRY	and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
2982	7	5.4.15	LANCASTER	We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
2983	7	5.4.16	LANCASTER	Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.
2984	7		LANCASTER	Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
2985	8	5.4.17	PRINCE HENRY	By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
2986	8	5.4.18	PRINCE HENRY	I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
2987	8	5.4.19	PRINCE HENRY	Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
2988	8	5.4.20	PRINCE HENRY	But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
2989	9	5.4.21	KING HENRY IV	I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
2990	9	5.4.22	KING HENRY IV	With lustier maintenance than I did look for
2991	9	5.4.23	KING HENRY IV	Of such an ungrown warrior.
2992	10	5.4.24	PRINCE HENRY	O, this boy
2993	10	5.4.25	PRINCE HENRY	Lends mettle to us all!
2994	10		PRINCE HENRY	Exit
2995	10		PRINCE HENRY	Enter DOUGLAS
2996	11	5.4.26	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
2997	11	5.4.27	EARL OF DOUGLAS	I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
2998	11	5.4.28	EARL OF DOUGLAS	That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
2999	11	5.4.29	EARL OF DOUGLAS	That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
3000	12	5.4.30	KING HENRY IV	The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
3001	12	5.4.31	KING HENRY IV	So many of his shadows thou hast met
3002	12	5.4.32	KING HENRY IV	And not the very king. I have two boys
3003	12	5.4.33	KING HENRY IV	Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
3004	12	5.4.34	KING HENRY IV	But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
3005	12	5.4.35	KING HENRY IV	I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.
3006	13	5.4.36	EARL OF DOUGLAS	I fear thou art another counterfeit;
3007	13	5.4.37	EARL OF DOUGLAS	And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
3008	13	5.4.38	EARL OF DOUGLAS	But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
3009	13	5.4.39	EARL OF DOUGLAS	And thus I win thee.
3010	13		EARL OF DOUGLAS	They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters
3011	14	5.4.40	PRINCE HENRY	Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
3012	14	5.4.41	PRINCE HENRY	Never to hold it up again! the spirits
3013	14	5.4.42	PRINCE HENRY	Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:
3014	14	5.4.43	PRINCE HENRY	It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
3015	14	5.4.44	PRINCE HENRY	Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
3016	14	5.4.44	PRINCE HENRY	They fight: DOUGLAS flies
3017	14	5.4.45	PRINCE HENRY	Cheerly, my lord	how fares your grace?
3018	14	5.4.46	PRINCE HENRY	Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
3019	14	5.4.47	PRINCE HENRY	And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
3020	15	5.4.48	KING HENRY IV	Stay, and breathe awhile:
3021	15	5.4.49	KING HENRY IV	Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
3022	15	5.4.50	KING HENRY IV	And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
3023	15	5.4.51	KING HENRY IV	In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
3024	16	5.4.52	PRINCE HENRY	O God! they did me too much injury
3025	16	5.4.53	PRINCE HENRY	That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
3026	16	5.4.54	PRINCE HENRY	If it were so, I might have let alone
3027	16	5.4.55	PRINCE HENRY	The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
3028	16	5.4.56	PRINCE HENRY	Which would have been as speedy in your end
3029	16	5.4.57	PRINCE HENRY	As all the poisonous potions in the world
3030	16	5.4.58	PRINCE HENRY	And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
3031	17	5.4.59	KING HENRY IV	Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
3032	17		KING HENRY IV	Exit
3033	17		KING HENRY IV	Enter HOTSPUR
3034	18	5.4.60	HOTSPUR	If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
3035	19	5.4.61	PRINCE HENRY	Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
3036	20	5.4.62	HOTSPUR	My name is Harry Percy.
3037	21	5.4.63	PRINCE HENRY	Why, then I see
3038	21	5.4.64	PRINCE HENRY	A very valiant rebel of the name.
3039	21	5.4.65	PRINCE HENRY	I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
3040	21	5.4.66	PRINCE HENRY	To share with me in glory any more:
3041	21	5.4.67	PRINCE HENRY	Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
3042	21	5.4.68	PRINCE HENRY	Nor can one England brook a double reign,
3043	21	5.4.69	PRINCE HENRY	Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
3044	22	5.4.70	HOTSPUR	Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
3045	22	5.4.71	HOTSPUR	To end the one of us; and would to God
3046	22	5.4.72	HOTSPUR	Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
3047	23	5.4.73	PRINCE HENRY	I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
3048	23	5.4.74	PRINCE HENRY	And all the budding honours on thy crest
3049	23	5.4.75	PRINCE HENRY	I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
3050	24	5.4.76	HOTSPUR	I can no longer brook thy vanities.
3051	24		HOTSPUR	They fight
3052	24		HOTSPUR	Enter FALSTAFF
3053	25	5.4.77	FALSTAFF	Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
3054	25	5.4.78	FALSTAFF	boy's play here, I can tell you.
3055	25	5.4.78	FALSTAFF	Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,  who falls down as if he were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls
3056	26	5.4.79	HOTSPUR	O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
3057	26	5.4.80	HOTSPUR	I better brook the loss of brittle life
3058	26	5.4.81	HOTSPUR	Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
3059	26	5.4.82	HOTSPUR	They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
3060	26	5.4.83	HOTSPUR	But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
3061	26	5.4.84	HOTSPUR	And time, that takes survey of all the world,
3062	26	5.4.85	HOTSPUR	Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
3063	26	5.4.86	HOTSPUR	But that the earthy and cold hand of death
3064	26	5.4.87	HOTSPUR	Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
3065	26	5.4.88	HOTSPUR	And food for--
3066	26		HOTSPUR	Dies
3067	27	5.4.89	PRINCE HENRY	For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
3068	27	5.4.90	PRINCE HENRY	Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
3069	27	5.4.91	PRINCE HENRY	When that this body did contain a spirit,
3070	27	5.4.92	PRINCE HENRY	A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
3071	27	5.4.93	PRINCE HENRY	But now two paces of the vilest earth
3072	27	5.4.94	PRINCE HENRY	Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
3073	27	5.4.95	PRINCE HENRY	Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
3074	27	5.4.96	PRINCE HENRY	If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
3075	27	5.4.97	PRINCE HENRY	I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
3076	27	5.4.98	PRINCE HENRY	But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
3077	27	5.4.99	PRINCE HENRY	And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
3078	27	5.4.100	PRINCE HENRY	For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
3079	27	5.4.101	PRINCE HENRY	Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
3080	27	5.4.102	PRINCE HENRY	Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
3081	27	5.4.103	PRINCE HENRY	But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
3082	27		PRINCE HENRY	He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
3083	27	5.4.104	PRINCE HENRY	What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
3084	27	5.4.105	PRINCE HENRY	Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
3085	27	5.4.106	PRINCE HENRY	I could have better spared a better man:
3086	27	5.4.107	PRINCE HENRY	O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
3087	27	5.4.108	PRINCE HENRY	If I were much in love with vanity!
3088	27	5.4.109	PRINCE HENRY	Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
3089	27	5.4.110	PRINCE HENRY	Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
3090	27	5.4.111	PRINCE HENRY	Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
3091	27	5.4.112	PRINCE HENRY	Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
3092	27		PRINCE HENRY	Exit PRINCE HENRY
3093	28	5.4.113	FALSTAFF	[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
3094	28	5.4.114	FALSTAFF	I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
3095	28	5.4.115	FALSTAFF	to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
3096	28	5.4.116	FALSTAFF	that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
3097	28	5.4.117	FALSTAFF	Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
3098	28	5.4.118	FALSTAFF	is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
3099	28	5.4.119	FALSTAFF	counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
3100	28	5.4.120	FALSTAFF	but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
3101	28	5.4.121	FALSTAFF	liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
3102	28	5.4.122	FALSTAFF	perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
3103	28	5.4.123	FALSTAFF	valour is discretion; in the which better part I
3104	28	5.4.124	FALSTAFF	have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
3105	28	5.4.125	FALSTAFF	gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
3106	28	5.4.126	FALSTAFF	should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
3107	28	5.4.127	FALSTAFF	afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
3108	28	5.4.128	FALSTAFF	Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
3109	28	5.4.129	FALSTAFF	killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
3110	28	5.4.130	FALSTAFF	Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
3111	28	5.4.131	FALSTAFF	Therefore, sirrah,
3112	28		FALSTAFF	Stabbing him
3113	28	5.4.132	FALSTAFF	with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.
3114	28		FALSTAFF	Takes up HOTSPUR on his back
3115	28		FALSTAFF	Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
3116	29	5.4.133	PRINCE HENRY	Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
3117	29	5.4.134	PRINCE HENRY	Thy maiden sword.
3118	30	5.4.135	LANCASTER	But, soft! whom have we here?
3119	30	5.4.136	LANCASTER	Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
3120	31	5.4.137	PRINCE HENRY	I did; I saw him dead,
3121	31	5.4.138	PRINCE HENRY	Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
3122	31	5.4.139	PRINCE HENRY	thou alive?
3123	31	5.4.140	PRINCE HENRY	Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
3124	31	5.4.141	PRINCE HENRY	I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
3125	31	5.4.142	PRINCE HENRY	Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
3126	32	5.4.143	FALSTAFF	No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
3127	32	5.4.144	FALSTAFF	be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
3128	32		FALSTAFF	Throwing the body down
3129	32	5.4.145	FALSTAFF	if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
3130	32	5.4.146	FALSTAFF	him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
3131	32	5.4.147	FALSTAFF	earl or duke, I can assure you.
3132	33	5.4.148	PRINCE HENRY	Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.
3133	34	5.4.149	FALSTAFF	Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
3134	34	5.4.150	FALSTAFF	lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
3135	34	5.4.151	FALSTAFF	and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
3136	34	5.4.152	FALSTAFF	fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
3137	34	5.4.153	FALSTAFF	believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
3138	34	5.4.154	FALSTAFF	valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
3139	34	5.4.155	FALSTAFF	it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
3140	34	5.4.156	FALSTAFF	thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
3141	34	5.4.157	FALSTAFF	'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
3142	35	5.4.158	LANCASTER	This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
3143	36	5.4.159	PRINCE HENRY	This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
3144	36	5.4.160	PRINCE HENRY	Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
3145	36	5.4.161	PRINCE HENRY	For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
3146	36	5.4.162	PRINCE HENRY	I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
3147	36		PRINCE HENRY	A retreat is sounded
3148	36	5.4.163	PRINCE HENRY	The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
3149	36	5.4.164	PRINCE HENRY	Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
3150	36	5.4.165	PRINCE HENRY	To see what friends are living, who are dead.
3151	36		PRINCE HENRY	Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER
3152	37	5.4.166	FALSTAFF	I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
3153	37	5.4.167	FALSTAFF	rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
3154	37	5.4.168	FALSTAFF	I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
3155	37	5.4.169	FALSTAFF	live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
3156	37		FALSTAFF	Exit
3157	37		FALSTAFF	SCENE V. Another part of the field.
3158	37		FALSTAFF	The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE  HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners
3159	1	5.5.1	KING HENRY IV	Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
3160	1	5.5.2	KING HENRY IV	Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
3161	1	5.5.3	KING HENRY IV	Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
3162	1	5.5.4	KING HENRY IV	And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
3163	1	5.5.5	KING HENRY IV	Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
3164	1	5.5.6	KING HENRY IV	Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
3165	1	5.5.7	KING HENRY IV	A noble earl and many a creature else
3166	1	5.5.8	KING HENRY IV	Had been alive this hour,
3167	1	5.5.9	KING HENRY IV	If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
3168	1	5.5.10	KING HENRY IV	Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
3169	2	5.5.11	EARL OF WORCESTER	What I have done my safety urged me to;
3170	2	5.5.12	EARL OF WORCESTER	And I embrace this fortune patiently,
3171	2	5.5.13	EARL OF WORCESTER	Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
3172	3	5.5.14	KING HENRY IV	Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
3173	3	5.5.15	KING HENRY IV	Other offenders we will pause upon.
3174	3		KING HENRY IV	Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded
3175	3	5.5.16	KING HENRY IV	How goes the field?
3176	4	5.5.17	PRINCE HENRY	The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
3177	4	5.5.18	PRINCE HENRY	The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
3178	4	5.5.19	PRINCE HENRY	The noble Percy slain, and all his men
3179	4	5.5.20	PRINCE HENRY	Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
3180	4	5.5.21	PRINCE HENRY	And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
3181	4	5.5.22	PRINCE HENRY	That the pursuers took him. At my tent
3182	4	5.5.23	PRINCE HENRY	The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
3183	4	5.5.24	PRINCE HENRY	I may dispose of him.
3184	5	5.5.25	KING HENRY IV	With all my heart.
3185	6	5.5.26	PRINCE HENRY	Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
3186	6	5.5.27	PRINCE HENRY	This honourable bounty shall belong:
3187	6	5.5.28	PRINCE HENRY	Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
3188	6	5.5.29	PRINCE HENRY	Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
3189	6	5.5.30	PRINCE HENRY	His valour shown upon our crests to-day
3190	6	5.5.31	PRINCE HENRY	Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
3191	6	5.5.32	PRINCE HENRY	Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
3192	7	5.5.33	LANCASTER	I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
3193	7	5.5.34	LANCASTER	Which I shall give away immediately.
3194	8	5.5.35	KING HENRY IV	Then this remains, that we divide our power.
3195	8	5.5.36	KING HENRY IV	You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
3196	8	5.5.37	KING HENRY IV	Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
3197	8	5.5.38	KING HENRY IV	To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
3198	8	5.5.39	KING HENRY IV	Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
3199	8	5.5.40	KING HENRY IV	Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
3200	8	5.5.41	KING HENRY IV	To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
3201	8	5.5.42	KING HENRY IV	Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
3202	8	5.5.43	KING HENRY IV	Meeting the cheque of such another day:
3203	8	5.5.44	KING HENRY IV	And since this business so fair is done,
3204	8	5.5.45	KING HENRY IV	Let us not leave till all our own be won.
3205	8		KING HENRY IV	Exeunt
